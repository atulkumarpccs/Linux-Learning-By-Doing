1. as we saw in the case of process management, modern 
   processors support logical / virtual addresses - 
   these are inturn exploited by operating system and
    passed on to processes/applications 

2. logical addresses are translated by processors
   and physical addresses are used to actually access
   physical memory 

3. translation of a given logical adddress to corresponding 
   physical address is a run time activity and depends
   on the allocation of physical memory regions to a process
   and where the process is loaded !!!

4. the above may be achieved using different hw techniques:
   
    - processor may support one set of mmeory mapping 
      registers - base and bound
    - processor may support a set of memmory mapping 
      registers - meaning, several base/bound registers
      maintained in a table - this is known as segment table -
      this approach is known segment based mm 
    - processor may support a modified version of the second
      approach, where segments are of equal size - this approach
      is known as page based mm  
   


5. let us assume that we have a simple processor 
   which supports a single base and bound register - it will 
   have the following features:
    
     - a process must be allocated a contiguous physical 
       memory region - if the process is very large or 
       contiguous phy mm regions are not available, 
       a process may be not be loaded
     - whenever a process switch occurs, base and bound 
       registers of the processor are loaded with the
       new set of values of the incoming process!!
     - in this scheme of phy mm, external fragmentation
       creates wastage of memory - this problem is 
       commonly known as external fragmentation !!
          - there are non contiguous memory regions that 
            are free and still cannot be allocated and used 
          - such free, non contiguous memory regions are
            said to be fragmented - such a phenomenon is 
            known as external fragmentation !!!!
          - in this context, external fragmentation causes
            wastage of memory - it may not be true in 
            all cases - we will understand this, as we progress !!!
     - for each process, base register's value is 
       decided by the phy mm of the operating system - 
       this information is stored in the pd of the process
     - this informato=ion is loaded into the base/bound 
       registers of the processor, when the process
       is scheduled by the scheduler !!! refer to process related
       text for more details on these mechanisms !!!    

6. in segment based mm, a segment table is allocated per process
   and several segment entries are managed in the table - each 
   entry contains a base/bound register set - it may also 
   contain other attributes - in addition, following rules/features
   are present :

    - segment table is defined by the processor and maintained
      in pd of each process- segment table is located in system space !!!
    - when a process is scheduled on the processor, base address
      of the segment table is loaded into a control register
      of the processor !!
    - when a process is loaded on the processor, logical addresss
      are translated with the help of respective segment table entry 
    - there will be n segments in  a process 
      each segment has a set of logical addresses associated
      with it - each logical segment is associated with one 
      segment table entry of this process !!! 
    - run time translation of a logical address to physical 
      address is done by MMU of the processor, which has 
      access to segment table via a control register of the processor !!!
    - if the above is true, what is the role of operating 
      system in segment based mem. management ??
        - to assign appropriate logical addresses/segments
          to a process !!!
        - not only assign logical addresses, also maintain
          information about these addresses in the pd of 
          the process !!
        - allocate a segment table per process
        - initialize base/bound registers of necessary entries
          in the segment table !!!
        - load the processor's control register with segment 
          table base address during scheduling of a process !!
     - by dividing a process into logical segments and mapping 
       to several non contiguous physical segments, a single 
       large contiguous phy mem region is not needed per process

     - a process logical address space is divided into logical 
       segments - meaning each logical segment contains a set 
       of logical addresses - a logical segment is associated 
       with a physical segment - such a mapping is done 
        with the help of a segment table entry allocated 
        in the segment table of this process !!!
     - for a set of logical addresses in a logical segment of 
       the process, a segment table entry serves the transalation 
       or mapping !!!
          say, logical address is lai - lai is divided into 
          2 parts - first part is the segment no and the second
          part is the offset - for example, segment no is made 
          up of 4 bits and offset part may be made  up of 14 bits
          ( this can vary from implmentation to implementation ) 
          - for a set of logical addresses in a logical segment, 
          the segment no part will be the same - offset part will be
          different !!!refer to chapter 11 of crowley and memory 
          section of all.pdf for more details !!!
     
          - if the seg no field is 13 bits, 8192 segments can
            be supported - will a process/application use 
            all the 8192 segments  ?? if  a process/application
            does not use 12 segments, how will the table be maintained ??


     - this minimizes wastage due to external fragmentation - 
       however, effects of external fragmentation are not 
       eliminated !! in any system, external fragmentation 
       may be inevitable - we can only reduce the effects 
       of external fragmentations - meaning, we can minimize the
       effects of external fragmentation !!!
     - in reality, sizes of logical segments of a process
       and sizes of free physical segments of memory in the
       system may not match , always - meaning, there will 
       be mismatch and wastage due to this 

Note: for instance, a process may be divided into multiple   
      segments based on different contents - say, code ,
      data, heap , stack, file mapping , libraries and 
      many more !!!
    
     - no. of segments of a process and sizes of segments 
       of a process need to be decided by the compiler or 
       developer, in most cases - this may lead to inefficient 
       implementation of segmentation for a process, as it 
       is difficult to predict the parameters for all cases !!!
         - it is a difficult question to answer and depends
           on the system's current set of processes and 
           system's current set of physical segments !!!
         - it is due to such practical problems that 
           page based memory management was introduced -
           page based memory management is an improvised
           form of segment based memory management !!1


 
Note :most of the above arguments as well as below arguments 
      are based on statistical study of general purpose applications 
      and gpos !!! you understand and use what suits your applications,
      development tools and operating system - do not consider 
      these as final arguments for all cases !!!
Note: 

       - what is a logical segment of a process ??

             - who generates logical addresses for logical 
               segments of processes  ?? what are the rules ??
                    - compiler/developer/memory manager and
                      other components of the operating system 
                    - processor decided the width of logical 
                      addresses and due to this, scope of 
                      logical addresses !!!
                    - on top of the hw scope/width, os decides
                      other sw /runtime rules 
                    - operating system also maintains the 
                      currently used logical addresses of 
                      a process and new addresses for a process
                      are allocated from unused addresses for 
                      that process !!!
              - if  a processor is typically 32 bit type and 
                logical address width is 32 bits, what will be 
                the scope of logical addresses/address space 
                for a given process ??
                       4GiB 
              - if a processor is typically 64 bit type and 
                logical address width is 44 bits, what will be 
                the scope of logical addresses/address space ??
                       16TiB 
              - depending upon logical address space scope,
                max size of application supported in a given 
                computing system may be decided !!!
              - if we have 100 processes in a given system, 
                what will be the max total logical address space
                utilized by all of the them ???
                     -in a 32 bit(32) system ??/
                             400GiB
 
                     - in  a 64 bit(44) system ??
                             1600TiB 

 

             - a range of logical addresses divided by the 
               compiler/developer/kernel and maintained 
               by the process manager and memory manager !!!!

             - what does a logical segment really represent ?? 
               in other words, what does it contain ?? 
                  - a logical segment represents a part of the 
                    contents of a process, in memory ???
                         - may be code/text 
                         - may be some type of data 
                         - may be some library code
                         - may be some shared memory segment 
                         - can be fairly anything supported by 
                           a process !!!
                   - take a simple program/process and validate
                     the logical / virtual addresses of various
                     segments of a process by printing those 
                     addresses !!!
                   - in a typical GPos, we may call these addresses
                     as virtual addresses and in a typical RTOS, 
                     we may call these addresses as logical !!!

              - if a logical address represents some content of 
                a program /process , in memory , which type address
                is used to represent some content of a program 
                on disk ????
                     - from an operating system perspective,
                       3 addresses may be used, in different 
                       contexts 
                        - first address is logical file byte number
                        - second address is logical file system byte number
                        - third address is the actual disk address(disk byte
                                                                   number) 
                        - you may come close to the first and at the most
                          to the second - third is mostly hidden from 
                          most developers !!!

             - if there is a new process and the loader of the operating 
               (process manager) must load some content of the process,
               it will use the logical addresses of the content and 
               load the corresponding content from the disk/file system -
               however, to do so, a given set of logical addresses must 
               be internally mapped to disk logical byte numbers - 
               how is this achieved ???  
                 
                  - this is achieved with the help of file system, 
                    I/O subsystems and device drivers !!! 
                  - the above steps are during loading of a program 
                    and process creation, not execution of the process
                    - during execution of the process, logical addresses
                      will be mapped to physical addresses with the 
                      help of segment table entries and processor !!!


7. page based memory management is similar to segment based
   memory management with following changes and features - 
   currently, most systems use page based memory management !!!
    - here, segments are of fixed and equal size 
    - a process is divided into logical pages - meaning, 
      a logical address space of a process is divided 
      into logical pages 
    - page size is typically 4KiB - although, other page sizes
      are supported by hw, 4Kib is still very popular and 
      efficient !!!this is highly dependent on the hw architecture 
      - of course, hw platform may support multiple page sizes - 
        in which case, it is the responsibility of the operatingsystem
        to select the appropriate size !!! 
    - if the page size is fixed and logical page size is fixed, 
      division of a process into logical pages is implicit and 
      no explicit effort is needed by os/compiler / developer !!!
    - total physical memory of the system is divided into 
      page size entities - these page size entities are knonwn 
      as page frames 
             - this is what make mapping logical pages
               to page frames , seamless !!

    - it is the responsibility of the operating system memory 
      manager to allocated page frames to processes as needed - 
      that is the role of page based phy memory manager !!!
        - it is the responsibility of the operating system 
          to maintain a free set of page frames and allocate
          as per the requirements of the applications/processes
          and even subsystems of the operating system !!!

    - every process is allocated a page-table - each page 
      table contains several entires - page table entires -
      ptes contain base address of a page frame and certain 
      attribute bits !!!

    - whenever a process is scheduled, it is the responsibilituy 
      of the scheduler to load the base address of the page table
      of the process into a control register of the processor !!!
    
    - effects due to external fragmentation on a process are
      eliminated - still, external fragmentation occurs !!!
      problem is solved for processes, not the entire system!!!
           - we still have external fragmentation 
           - however, there is no wastage due to processes
           - there may still be problems for the system as a whole !!! 
                 - operating system may need contiguous physical 
                   memory regions for other sections of th e
                   system space and external fragmentation 
                   may still be a problem
 
    - as before a process image based on logical addresses is the 
      same - just that different sections of a process are further
      divided into logical pages and this division is implicit and 
      that is the reason that it is not shown in the diagram !!!



- is there any difference between segment table and page table ???
        
      - you can assume that we will be discussing about 32 bit systems - 
        32 bit systems are typically used to learn and teach, but 
        most principles apply to 64 bit systems and implementation
        details will differ !!! 


    - before we look into problems in page based memory management,
      let us understand a bit more on ptes !!!
       - although the physical addresses are 32-bits, 20 bits
         are stored in a pte, not 32 bits - why ??
            - see below 
       
       - apart from the base address of the page frame, 
         pte also contains P - present bit and 
         protection bits !!!

            - what is the role of P - present bit or valid 
              bit  in pte ?? if P bit is 1, pte entry is said
              to be valid and used by MMU - if P bit 0, pte 
              entry is invalid and MMU will generate page 
              fault exception !!! it is the responsibility
              of operating system to modify P bit appropriately !!! 


                 - can you give a scenario when the P bit will be
                   1 ??
                       - every process is given a maximum 
                         logical address space scope that is 
                         provided by the underlying hw architecture !!!
                         - for example, what is the max logical 
                           address space scope for a 32-bit system/processor??
                             - it is 4GiB = 4 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes
                         - based on this scope, a process may use all
                           the logical address space for building its
                           logical pages - if the process size is not 
                           so big, it will use only a subset of logical
                           pages - these logical pages will have corresponsing 
                           ptes with P bit set to 1 - for unused logical 
                           pages, P bit will be reset to 0 - in otherwords,
                           used, valid logical pages will have their                                   corresponding pte's P bit set to 1
                           - these are valid logical pages of a process !!!

                 - can you give a scenario when the P bit will be
                   0 ?? 
                         - for unused, invalid logical pages 
                         - if a  process attempts to access 
                           unused logical page addresses, 
                           hw will generate page fault exception -  
                           operating system will handle such an 
                           exception with an exception handler -        
                           the process will be terminated - this 
                           is the typical arrangement on a modern 
                           day processor and modern day OS !!!
                              

            - protection bits associated with a pte define
              access permissions allowed on the associated
              logical page and page frame - meaning, protection
              bits can enforce read only access, r/w access,
              and many more - it is the responsibility of the 
              operating system to set the protection bits of 
              ptes as needed !! operating system will set these
              protection bits as per the contents managed by a
              logical page and its page frame !!1
                - what is the meaning of this ???
                     - ptes corresponding logical pages of text 
                       will have r/w bit set to 0
                     - ptes corresponding to logical pages of 
                       data will have r/w bit set to 1
                     - this set up continues to serve its purpose !!
                     - the objective is to restrict the access permissions
                       to respective logical pages based on their 
                       contents - what happens if a logical page set to 
                       read only is accessed for writing ???

       - a typical pte is of 32 bits size 

       - let the logical address be 0x0804 8000 - what is 
         the logical page assoicated with this - meaning,
         logical page no ??

                   0x08048 is the logical page no !!!
             - given this logical page no, what are the range 
               of logical addresses contained in this logical page ???
                   0x08048000  to 0x08048fff 

       - in the above case, what is the offset associated 
         with the logical address ??

                   0x000 is the offset associated 


       - let us assume the page frame base address is 
           0x0001 2000

              - given the page frame no is 0x00012, 
                what are the physical addresses used to address
                all the bytes in the page frame ??
                  - 0x00012000 to  0x00012fff  

 
              - 0x00012 will be stored as page frame no
                in the pte 
              - last 12 bits are dropped - because they 
                are any way 000s - since 0s are still needed
                eventually, they will dropped and added when 
                needed !!!          
   
       - during translation, logical page frame no. is used
         to index into the page table and extract pte - 
         once extracted, page frame base address is constructed
         by adding 12 0s to the page frame no - after this,
         offset of the logical address is added to the 
         page frame base address - end result is physical
         memory address !!! 
       - based on the above example, explore the translations
         and mappings of different logical addresses to 
         physical addresses 
       - logical addresses of a logical page are mapped to physical
         addresses of a page frame with help of a single pte 
         entry - meaning, if the page frame size is 4096 bytes, 
         4096 logical addresses of a logical page are mapped 
         to 4096 physical addresses of a page frame,using a single pte of 
         a secondary page table  !!!
       - what is the maximum size of logical address space
         allowed for a process ?? 
               - approx 3GiB - this is due to the fact that approximately 
                 1GiB of a process address space is dedicated to 
                 system space - this is true in the case of every 
                 process in the system !!

            what does this no. depend on ?? processor's
                 logical address width and os implementation !!
                  - you may come across the following in the 
                    future :
                         - 3GiB : 1GiB 
                         - 2GiB : 2 GiB
                         - 128TiB : 128TiB 
                         - 512GiB : 512 GiB 

                  - it all depends on the underlying architecture
                    and the operating system implementation !!!
                        
       - how many logical address spaces can exist in the system 
         - how are several logical address spaces of several processes
         managed in the system ??

                - as many as we want , but only one logical address
                  space is actively used by processor !!! which logical
                  address space here means, which processe's logical 
                  address space ?? of the current process - meaning,
                  the process that is running on the processor !!!
         - how are several logical address spaces of several processes
         managed in the system ??

                - as many as we want , but only logical address
                  space is actively used by processor !!! 

                - several here means several processes lead to 
                  several logical address spaces !!

       - how is the size of a process related to logical address
         space of a process ?? 

                - each byte of the process needs one logical address


       - how is the page table of a process
         related  to size of a process ??

             - no of ptes is directly proportional to  logical 
               pages of the process, which in turn is dependent
               on size of the process and page size of the system !!
                 - although the above statement is true, 
                   in the case of a single level page table, 
                   no of ptes in a page table is not dependent
                   on the process size, it is fixed - meaning, 
                   no of ptes is fixed based on the maximum 
                   logical address space of the underlying hw and
                   the page size of the system 
                 - for instance, let us assume that the system 
                   is a 32 bit system - page size is 4096 bytes
                   and max logical addresss space scope is 
                   4GiB 
                      - this means, the no of ptes is 1 Mi entries
                        per page table - which is also per process
                      - assuming the pte size is 4bytes, each process
                        will be needing a page table of size 4MiB 
                        irrespective of the process size ???
                      - this implementation is inefficient - such 
                        problems are true whether we are dealing 
                        GPOS/RTOS/EOS/MOS  !!! 

       - what is the largest application /process that may be 
         executed in  a 32bit system ??
             - ideally, the answer is 4GiB (2 power 32)
             - due to practical reasons and operating system
               implementation, it is approx 3GiB - if a 3GiB 
               process is active what will be the size of 
               its logical address space !!! same as 
               size of the process !!!
             - in this case, 1GiB is allocated to system space 
               (reserved) in each process !!! what is the meaning 
               of this ?? 
                     - assuming, we are currently dealing with 
                       a single level page tables, what is your
                       interpretation ??? 


                     - system space contains kernel/microkernel
                       !! how many kernels are maintained inm 
                       system space ??? only one !!!

                     - how this managed since every process 
                       has 1GiB allocated to system space ???
                        - in a single level page table system, 
                          certain page table entries of every 
                          process (corresponding to 1GiB logical 
                          address space reserved for system space)
                          will be mapped to the same set of page frames
                          containing kernel/micro kernel !!! such 
                          implementation tricks are very popular 
                          in operating systems and the core of 
                          operating systems !!!

Note: like userspace, system space also uses logical addresses
      ,page tables, ptes and page frames - how this is implemented 
      varies from user-space implementation !!!


        - multi-level page tables vs single level page table ??

          - if single level page table is used to map logical 
            addresses of a process to physical addresses of 
            page frames, very large amount of memory is wasted       
            in managing / maintaining page tables 

          - the above problem can be minimized by using 
            multilevel page tables - we will be discussing 
            with the help of 2 level page tables - in reality,
            there are 3 level and 4 level as well !!!

          - as per h/w design single level page table 
            must support max. logical address space 
            supported by hw - for example, in a 32bit system,
            4GiB is the max. logical address space and 
            page size is 4KiB - what will be the size of 
            single level page table per process ?? 
                - size of a page table is 4MiB per 
                  process 
                - overhead of a single level page 
                  table is very high - unacceptable 

          - this where, multilevel page tables were introduced
          - there will be a primary page table and several secondary 
            page tables - no. of secondary page tables is dependent 
            on the process size 
          - primary page table size is typically 4KiB - its role
            is to store base addresses of secondary page tables -
            secondary page tables of 4KiB in size - role of 
            secondary page tables is to store base addresses/attributes
            of page frames !!!
          - no. of pte entries per primary page table is 1024 and 
            no. of pte entries in each secondary page table is 1024 
              - for a process with vsz = 32KiB,
                  - how many ptes are needed ??
                        8 ptes !!!
                       
                  - how many secondary page tables are needed ??
                        1 secondary page table

                  - how many primary page tables are needed ???
                        1 primary page table 

                 

Note:  vsz is the size of a process - vsz is sum of all the 
       valid logical pages of a process !!!

                primary + secondary page tables size = 8KIB 


              - for vsz = 32MiB, what is the size
                needed for primary and secondary page tables ??

                  - how many ptes are needed ??
                         32 MiB / 4KiB = 8 * 1024  ptes !!!
                       
                  - how many secondary page tables are needed ??
                         8 secondary page tables                        

                  - how many primary page tables are needed ???
                        1 primary page table



                         36KiB is the memory needed for 
                         primary page tables + secondary page tables !!!
 
          - this scheme uses memory efficiently for 
            page tables !!!

          - given a logical address, first 10 bits are used to 
            index into primary page table to fetch the base
            address of secondary page table - next 10 bits
            of logical address are used to fetch pte in the 
            secondary page table - next 12 bits are treated 
            as offset to be added to the base address of th e
            page frame extracted from pte of the secondary 
            page table - this is the translated physical address !!!

         - one more attribute field in the pte is of interest - 
           this bit is known as u/s bit, which decides whether
           the logical page / page frame associated belong 
           to user-space or system space - if u/s bit is set 
           to 0, logical page and page frame belong to 
           system space - if u/s bit is set to 1, logical page
           and page frame belong to user-space !!!

         - is it possible to visualize user-space vs system space
           with th e help of page tables and ptes !!1
           - for ptes in secondary page tables that are used to 
             manage page frames of a process, u/s bit is set to 1 - 
             these page frames belong to user-space
           - for ptes in secondary page tables that are used to 
             manage page frames of system space, u/s bit is set to 0-
             these page frames belong to system space !!
               - this above arrangement is true for secondary page
                 tables of every process, in the system - meaning, 
                 for a given process, a set of secondary page tables
                 are dedicated to manage user space of the process and
                 a set of dedicated secondary page tables are used to
                 manage system space mapping !!!

         - in most modern operating systems, part of the logical 
           address space of a process is used for user-space 
           of the process and the other part is used for system 
           space - this is true for every process in the system -
           how is this achieved ??? 
             - for example 3GiB may be dedicated for user-space
               and 1GiB may dedicated for system space - this 
               can from system to system !!!
             - certain secondary page tables of each process
               are dedicated to managing / mapping logical 
               pages of the system to page frames of the system - 
               meaning, u/s bit will be set to 0 in these ptes
             - these logical addresses are only used by kernel 
               code / data - never used by user-space 
             - these dedicated secondary page table entries
               of processes map to the same set of page frames, 
               which are used by system space to load system 
               space code and data !!!  

          - for a process that is using logical addresss space 
            , logical pages and logical addresses, following is 
            true :
                - every logical page has an associated page frame
                  and once associated, this is fixed !!
                - this means,content of every logical page is 
                  loaded into main memory 
                    - how are the contents of a logical page 
                      loaded into the appropriate page frame
                      ??? what is the mechanism ???
                    - if we need to load contents of logical 
                      page associated with code area of the
                      current process, where will it be loaded 
                      from ??? typically from a file that is 
                               located in a file system !!! 
                               file system will be located on 
                               some storage device !!!
                - logical address space is managed with the help
                  of descriptors in pd - these descrs. are maintained
                  as part of mm struct / object !! 
                - no. of descriptors used to describe logical 
                  address space of the process is dependent on 
                  no .of sections in the process - typically, it 
                  may be 5 or more !!1
                - each such descriptor describes the range of 
                  associated logical addresses and other attributes
                - for a given descriptor, a set of secondary page
                  tables are managed - certain attributes of ptes
                  in these secondary page tables are controlled 
                  by attributes stored in descriptors !!!
                 - what is the exact relationship between a given address space
                   descriptor and secondary page tables ???
                       --- 

                - the use of these descriptors will be more 
                  clear when we discuss virtual memory management !!!


Note: typically, the above setup is done when a process is created and loaded
      into memory, assuming logical address space is used for processes !!





                - how are page fault exceptions connected 
                  to operating system core , not processes ???
                      - each exception is associated with 
                        a given exception handler in the 
                        system space !!!
                      - in this case, page fault exception handler
                        will be invoked and page fault exceptionb 
                        handler is part of process memory 
                        manager !!!
