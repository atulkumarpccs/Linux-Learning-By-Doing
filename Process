1. any operating system uses an entity known as process to 
   manage an active applicatiion/program - an active instance
   of an application is a process, in an operating system !!!

2. in a multitasking system, there can be several processes 
   existing in the system
    - how are the different processes in the system maintained ??
      - process control block or process descriptor 
        is the name given to objects used to manage 
        processes in the system - there is one process 
        descriptor per process - each process also 
        has an assigned, unique process id maintained in 
        the process descriptor !!!
    - process manager subsystem is responsible for 
      managing processes in the system !!!
       - process manager maintains process descriptors
         in a process descriptor table or process descriptor
         list 

 

3. a process may be understood from user-space/application 
   perspective or system - space / kernel perspective !!!

4. let us first have a look at user-space perspective - 
   following is a set of details:
    - there is a process layout in user-space address-space
      of the process !!
    - user-space address space of the process is made up 
      of logical addresses or virtual addresses !! 
    - is this real ?? if so, what is the reality and 
      who manages is this reality ??
    - address-space of a process is further divided into 
      different parts - one part manages code, another 
      part manages data, yet another part manages stack and
      so on - these parts are known as sections/segments
      of an active application !!1 

5. let us understand processes from kernel / system space
   perspective - to do so, we need to understand the information 
   maintained in a process descriptor - process descriptor
   maintains a lot of information - some are static and 
   some are dynamic :

   - a newly created process is added to ready state - meaning,
     state is changed to ready and pd is added to ready queue
     of the system - ready queue is where are proceses that 
     are ready to execute are maintained - meaning, these
     processes have been allocated all other resources, but 
     the processor - scheduler scans ready queue, whenever it 
     needs to select a new process to be allocated the processor !!!   
        - how is the scheduler scheduled ?? who schedules 
          the scheduler ?? how is it executed ??
        - cpu scheduler is not a process !!!
        - scheduler may get invoked due to certain events in the 
          system - one such event is a process termination - another such event is hw interrupt - there are many other events
due to which scheduler may be invoked - it is a component of the operating system kernel and it is made up of several routines - one or more of which will be invoked during scheduling activities !!!


   - if a process is selected by the scheduler to be executed on
     the processor, its state is changed from ready to running -
     meaning, process is scheduled to execute on the processor - 
     system normally maintains a pointer/variable that points to 
     a process descriptor that is currently running - this enables the system to manage a current process, efficiently !!!

   - a process that is running may request for a logical or 
     physical resource and corresponding resource may be 
     temporarily unavailable !!! in this case, process state
     is changed to blocked/waiting/sleeping and pd is added
     the corresponding waitqueue of the resource, in the system

   - when a resource is available and a process is waiting/blocking
     for the resource, if the resource is available, it is the 
      responsibility of the system to wake-up the process !!
     - state of the process is changed to ready and added to 
       ready queue and remove it from wait queue  - 
       it is the responsibility of the scheduler to assign    		  processor to the process, as per scheduling policy 
       and merit of the process !!!

   - when a process is executing on the processor, due to scheduling  policy and merit of the process, system may preempt the process from the processor - meaning, scheduler will forcibly remove  the process from running state and add it to ready state - this mechanism is known as preemption of a process !!!
     
   - if a process terminates normally or abnormally, it enters the terminated state - in the terminated state, all resources  allocated to the process are freed and process descriptor is 
     also freed - in addition, process id is also freed !!!
      - what is meant by normal termination of a process ??
        - when a process completes it work of executing 
          the associated program's code and invokes 
          exit() API - typically, exit() API is responsible
          for termination of the process !!! if we do not 
          use exit(), compiler's code associated with our 
          process will end up calling exit !!!it is treated
          as good convention to invoke exit() explicitly by
          the developer !!!
          - exit ends up calling _exit() system call API 
          - _exit() frees the resources and ends up 
            calling scheduler of the operating system !!!
          - how control flows from one part of the system 
            to another part of the system ???

      - what is meant by abnormal termination of a process ??
          when a process is forced to terminate, we say 
         that the process is abnormally terminated - forced
         termination may occur to due to one of the reasons- 
         user/developer/adminis. may forcibly terminate a 
         process or process may get involved in certain 
         illegal memory or other actitvities and system 
         decides to forcibly terminate the process !!
          - this is typically done in one of the 2 ways:
                - system may forcibly terminate a process
                  by generating a notification to the process !!1
                - administrator/ another process may generate 
                 a notification to the process - in this case, 
                 a system call may be used to generate the notification !!!
              
   - stopped state is a very peculiar state - it enables user/developer
     /adminis. or system to forcibly stop a process - this is 
     not same as termination - in this state, resources of the 
     process are still present, not deallocated !! system or 
     user/developer/adminis. can wake -up the process, forcibly - 
     this state is more for convenience !!   
            - using certain system calls, it is possible to 
              forcibly stop a process and resume a process !!!
            - why would you do this ??
            - can you name another usage where certain 
              tools may stop and resume a process without 
              user/adminstrator  intervention ????
                  - debugging tools use this feature !!! 


6. to understand processes further, let us understand certain 
   details presented in certain chapters of "operating system 
   by design - charles crowley" following are some important 
   points that we will gain :

     - we will be able to understand how a process is created
       and pd is initialized 
     - what do you understand if a process is said to be executing 
       in user-space ???
         - executing in virtual memory environment 
         - executing in less priviliged mode 
         - hw interrupts are enabled 
         - not executing system calls 
         - code of the program./ application associated 
           with process is executed !!!
       
     - how a process executes in system space 
        - what do you understand if a process is executing in system space ??
               - executing in logical memory environmnet !!
               - executing in priviliged mode 
               - hw interrupts may be disabled during 
                 certain sections of system call executions !!!
               - executes system space code/kernel code, not 
                 user-space application code !!!
     - if a process is currently executing a system call API 
       and system space code is executing, do we say that 
       process is executing or system is executing ???
           - in this case, process is executing - not ,
             system !!! as we discussed earlier, system 
             code is passive - they are not scheduled - 
             they are just invoked in the context of 
             respective process !!! 

     - enables us to understand context saving of a process
     - enables us to understand context switching between 
       processes
     - enables us to understand the impact of interrupts
       on processes
     - enables us to understand scheduler's working 
     - enables us to understand user-space preemption 
     - enables us to understand system-space preemption
     - enables us to understand timer interrupt handling 
     - enables us to understand system call interrupt handler
       and system call system routines !!  


7. chapter 2 of charles crowley :
   
   - physical memory addresses are used by processor and
     memory controller to actually access physical memory 
   - range of physical addresses allocated to available 
     physical memory in the system is known as physical
     address space !!! 
   - logical addresses or logical address space is 
     a mechanism provided by processor - this is visible
     to operating system and processes - in fact, these
     are the addresses typically used by developer, when
     we deal with pointers in our processes !!! 
   - it is the responsibility of processes to use 
     logical addresses and it is the responsibility of 
     the processor to translate these logical addresses
     to physical addresses during run-time, using memory 
     management unit - this memory management unit will 
     in turn use the help of operating system and a operating
      system provided mapping tables - this is a long story, 
     which will be discussed during memory management !!!
   - there are dedicated addresses used by a computing system 
     to access h/w controllers - these addresses may be 
     located in I/O address space or memory address space - 
     in either case, these addresses are used to access 
     h/w controllers by kernel components or device drivers !
   - understanding general purpose registers and special 
     purpose, control registers helps in understanding 
     certain details of process execution / management !!
   - psw is the processor status word - it is a control
     register - it has several bits, normally - in our 
     reference it only contains 2 bits - bit 0 and bit 1:
     - bit 0 is the priviliged mode bit - 0 means, processor
       is in priviliged state - 1 means, processor is in 
       less priviliged state
     - bit 1 is the interrupt enable bit - if this bit is 
       set to 0, h/w interrupts will be ignored by the processor
       - if this bit is set to 1, h/w interrupts are enabled - 
       meaning, processor will take action !!!  
     - psw bits may be controlled implicitly or explicitly - 
       we will see the details as we progress into other
       chapters !!!
      
8. chapter 3 of crowley :
   
   - there is a diagram that clearly explains what happens during  invokation of a system call API and also when a system call execution completes !!!     

     - a brief description of the events are below:
	- when the system call API executes the machine instruction, 
       ia is saved in iia and psw is saved in ipsw , by th e
       processor - in addition, 0 is loaded into psw - what is
       the consequence of loading 0 into psw ??? bit 0 is set to 0-
       process/processor is switched from less priviliged mode 
       to priviliged mode !!! bit 1 is set to 0 - processor
       will ignore h/w interrupts - in short, as long as bit 1 is 
       set to 0, no hw interrupt will be serviced !!! 
     - address of system call interrupt handler is loaded into 
       processor and a jump to interrupt handler is executed

     - eventually, rti machine instruction is executed - this will
       ensure that iia is moved into ia and ipsw is moved int o 
       psw - process resumes execution in user-space process
       that executed the system callAPI  

9. chapter 5 of crowley :

   - if a process is executing in user-space, following are
     true:

      - assuming scheduler has given sufficient time to 
        the process, it will continue executing - if 
        time slice / time share is non-zero / not exhausted !!!
      - if  interrupts are generated, operating system will 
        take temporary control and may lead to rescheduling 
      - the other possiblity is a system call API invocation -
        this may lead to execution of kernel-space code and 
        also, may lead to blocking of the current process or 
        rescheduling  
      - there is one more possibility of occurrence of exceptions
        - exceptions may lead to termination of the current process !!!
      - understanding processes and understanding process control 
        needs understanding of system space execution due to 
        interrupts, system call APIs and exceptions - first 2 we
        will discuss in this context - exceptions will be discussed
        during memory management !!!       

      - understanding system call execution in system - space - 
        in this chapter, there are certain assumptions to simplify 
        the discussions - we will eventually list the limitations
        due the simplifications given here !!! in addition, we will
        look into a more complex model in chapter 6, which is 
        more realiistic, but difficult to comprehend !! following are
        key points from chapter 5 of crowley:
        - a  simple pd is used 
        - a process descriptor table containing limited no. of 
          pds are used
        - a single system stack is used among all the processes
        - h/w interrupt processing is disabled during 
          system-space execution !! typically, during system 
          call execution and interrupt handler execution !!
        - a process cannot be blocked during a system call execution !!!
        - a process can be preempted during user-space execution 
        - a process cannot be preempted during system-space execution !!!
        - h/w context of a process/processor registers' state is saved
          in pd !! in the save area field of the pd !!!
           - it is more practical to save h.w contexts on 
             system stack of the process !!!
        - in most modern operating systems, operating system 
          /kernel is responsible for creating and launching 
          the first user-space process, in the system !!!
        - in addition, it a natural way by which a new process
          is invariably created by another process - new process
          may be known as child process and the creating process
          is known as parent process !!!

        - in the system call interrupt handler of this model,
          following are done:
            - hw context is saved - why is this context saved ??
              - what does it represent ?? user-space execution 
                context !!!
            - general purpose registers' state is saved and 
              special purpose registers' state is also saved
              in the save area !!
            - stack pointer is replaced with system-stack's 
              top most address - stack typically grows top
              - down - higher addresses to lower addresses !!!
            - r8 is stored into a local variable - r8 contains
              system call no. of a system call API - once 
              system call no. is retrieved, we can invoke the
              appropriate system call system routine !! 
            - in our current discussion, let us assume that 
              process creation system call is being invoked - 
              meaning, a new process is to be created by 
              the current process !!!
            - further, other parameters are retrieved from 
               other possible registers - once the parameters
               are retrieved, they are passed to system call system
               routine !!!
            - once a specific system call system routine is 
              executed, control is given back to system call 
              interrupt handler - system call interrupt handler 
              will end up invoking scheduler - in short control 
              is passed to scheduler() !!
            - whenever a system call execution is activated,
              after the execution, scheduler is invoked - this 
              is one good point where scheduler is given control
              by the system !!!  
            - is scheduler() a piece of code or is scheduler() 
              a process ?? it is just a piece of code invoked 
              by the system as per certain rules - the points
              where scheduler is invoked are known as preemption 
              points !!! whenever scheduler is invoked, there
              is a possibility of rescheduling - if there is a 
              rescheduling, it forcibly removes the current process
              from the processor and reassigns the processor to 
              another process - this action is typically known         
              as preemption of a process - due to this, points where
              scheduler is invoked in the operating system 
              are known as preemption points !!!
            - following are the actions taken in createprocess
              sysproc() system call system routine :
                - allocate a new process descriptor 
                - allocate physical memory 
                - initialize save area fields with appropriate 
                  values - save area is used duriong process 
                  creation and during run time of the process !!!
                - initial logical address is set to 0 
                - process is forced to execute in users-space 
                  by setting psw bit0 to 1 - process is forced
                  to execute in user-space with interrupts enabled
                  by setting psw bit 1 to 1 
                - program code and data are loaded into the allocated 
                  main memory !!!
                - state of the process is set to ready 
                - if everything is successfully done,process id 
                  is returned 
                - if there is a failure, -1 or -ve error code is
                  returned !!!
                - process creation is of 3 stages:
                     - pd allocation 
                     - resource allocation and pd initializatiom 
                     - loading code/data and other sections of the process
                       into memory
                - why save area fields are initialized during 
                  process creation ???
                      - here, save area is not used to save, 
                        it is used to initialize the contetx 
                        of processor registers, when this process
                        will be scheduled !!1
                      - if this initialization is not done, 
                        when the process is scheduled, cpu 
                        will start executing arbitrary code
                        and crash !!! 
                  - after the first scheduling of a newly 
                    created process, save area is more 
                    used for saving run-time h/w context !!!
 
            - assuming system call system routine has created a 
              new process and returned to system call interrupt 
              handler - this leads to execution of scheduler 
            - scheduler is made up of 2 routines
            - first routine does the following :
              - verifying whether the current process is 
                eligible for execution - state must be ready
                and the other is scheduling parameter as per
                policy - here, we are assuming time-slice based
                policy - time slice must be non-zero !!
              - if current process is not eligible to execute 
                due to one or more reasons, another ready 
                process is selected, allocated a new time-slice 
                and scheduled on the processor !!!
            - in the normal case, current process will be 
              resumed by the scheduler by loading the user-space
              hw context that was saved during system call API
              invokation - in fact, it is the responsibility of
              the scheduler to dispatch the current process using 
              the saved context information !!!  

           -  in this discussion following is the summary :
               - current process invokes a process creation 
                 system call API
               - system call system routine has created a
                 new process/pd and initialized its fields - 
                 new process is in ready state
               - after this, scheduler is invoked and 
                 current process is resumed in user-space
                 using h./w context that was saved during 
                 system call API invokation 
               - once again, current process resumes execution
                 in user-space - new process is in ready state
                 waiting for scheduling by scheduler
               - when the merit of new process is high enough, 
                 scheduler will use save area context of new 
                 process and dispatch it on the processor !!!   



      - in most modern systems, time-sharing / time-slicing 
        is used for implementing multi-tasking - multitasking 
        ensures that all processes in the system get a fair
        time-share and almost execute concurrently !!! time
        multiplexing of cpu cycles - this is done with 
        fine granularity - in the order of milliseconds - 
        users /developers do not see this kind of fine 
        granularity - it appears that all processes/applications
        are active at the same time !!!

      - for time-sharing/time-slicing, service of timer hw 
        and timer interrupt handler is needed !!!     

      - whenever a timer interrupt occurs, timer interrupt handler
        resets the time-slice of the current process to 0 - meaning,
        it notifies the process and the system that time-slice
        of the current process has expired !!!
             - current process has executed on the processor
               for the duration of time-slice and it is
               time for another process to be rescheduled !!!
      - scheduler is invoked typically in system call interrupt 
        handler and timer interrupt handler - in addition, scheduler
        is invoked in all interrupt handlers !!

      - timer interrupt handler ends up invoking scheduler -  
        as always, scheduler verifies time-slice and state -
        since time-slice is 0, current process is preempted 
        and another ready process is selected for dispatching !!!
    
      - hw context of the newly selected process is loaded
        into the registers of the processor by the scheduler
        - if the process is executing for the first time
          after creation, the context will that of the 
          initial context set up by process  creation 
        - if the process is not executing for the first time   
          after creation, it will be the saved context of the 
          process by the system - irrespective of the origin
          of hw context,scheduler does the same type 
          of hw context restoration !!!  
      - time-slice based scheduling policy leads to user-space
        preemption in this context !!!
      
      - what is system space preemption ??? in the current context 
        of discussion, can we expect system space preemption 
        of a process ???
           - assume that our process has executed a system call
             API and system call API is executing in system space -
             during this execution, a timer interrupt may occur,
             as interrupts are asynchronous - if so, do you 
             expect a premption of current process, in this 
             scenario ??? not allowed in this context of 
             discussion !!!
           - what is the value of bit 1 of psw when process
             is executing in system space - 0 
           - assuming that bit 1 is explicitly set to 1 by
             the operating system, what will happen ??
              - if a timer interrupt is generated, what 
                will happen ???
                  - h/w context will be saved in save
                    area of pd !!! this will overwrite
                    the previously saved user-space context 
                    of the process, when system call API was invoked !!1
                  - this is unacceptable !!!
                  - which means, hw interrupts must not be enabled - 
                    however, this design is unacceptable in a 
                    modern day operating system - this design was 
                    used 10-15 years back - today, design has changed !!!
       - in this context of discussion, is it possible to block a 
         process while a process is executing in a system call API !!!
             ?????????
           - let us assume that the current process may be bl;ocked
             by the current system call API
           - to do so, current system call API must save the h/w 
             context of the current process in the save area - this
             is needed to restore the execution of the current 
             process in system space - however, this will lead 
             to overwritting of the user-space context that was 
             saved when the respective system call API was invoked
             by the current process - this is again unacceptable !!!
           
       - system call APIs are not blocked - system call APIs block 
         a current process !!!

       - is it acceptable to disable hw interrupts in system space
         during execution of a system call routine ?? 
       - what will be the consequence ???
            - time slicing may not be properly implemented - 
              some processes may end up allocting more time-slice
              and some may allocate less time slice !!!
            - processes may not be responsive - meaning, a process
              that must be scheduled may be scheduled later 
              due to such extended system call activities !!1
            - I/O devices may not be serviced promptly and this
              may lead to loss of data or loss of event due to 
              delayed action !!!
            - in the case of embedded / realtime scenarios, 
              these are unacceptable delays - in the case of 
              other computing, it may or may not be acceptable 
              depending upon the application that is executing 
              in the system !!!! 

    


10. chapter 6 of crowley :
      - we will understand the following:
           - system space preemption 
           - system call API and blocking 
           - nested interrupts
           - usage of system stack for context saving !!1

    - this chapter deals with system space execution of 
      processes using better context saving and better 
      preemption techniques !!!

    - why is blocking inside a system call, indispensable ???
       - this does not mean that system calls block 
         processes, always - it only means that a system 
         call may block a process, if a resource is unavailable
         and waiting for an event is a must !!! 
    - in chapter 6, a new model, which is more practical is
      used - following are the advantages :
        - process descriptor is more sophiticated - it 
          has fields to note whether the process is executing 
          in user-space or system-space !!!
        - each pd has its own kernel stack or system stack - in
          ch5, only one system stack was used for all processes !!!
        - system stack is used for storing hw contexts - multiple
          hw contexts can be saved in system - stack - in chp5,
          only one hw context can be saved in pd  !!!
        - hw interrupts are reenabled during a system call 
          execution !! hw interrupts were disabled in ch5 context !!!
        - kernel space preemption is allowed in this model !!
        - a system call may block the current process, if 
          needed, in system space !! this feature is enabled
          due to above features !!!  
    - for a newly created process, addition initialization 
      steps are needed - insystem counter must be initialized to 0-
      lastsa pointer must be initialized to NULL !!! if insystem 
      counter is +ve, process is executing in system space - otherwise,
      process is executing in user-space !!!
      
    - whenever there is a system call API or interrupt, current 
      process context is saved on system stack - in addition, system
      maintains enough info. to manage all saved contexts and 
      the latest saved context as well - in addition, insystem 
      counter is incremented !! each time insystem counter is  
      incremented, it means, our process is deeply nested in 
      system space execution !!! in addition, hw interrupts
      are typically disabled after a system call API or 
      interrupt - in chapter 5 model, it is left as disabled -
      in chapter 6 model, hw interrupts are reenabled - this 
      will increase the responsiveness of the system to 
      I/O interrupts and certain scheduling policies !! overall,
      system responsiveness will increase due to reenabling 
      of hw interrupts in system space !!!   
          - insystem is set to 1 when a system call API is invoked !!
          - when will insystem counter be +ve > 1 - when executing 
            in system  space, further hw interrupts may be generated !!!
 
    
     - in this new model, assuming context saving and interrupt 
       handling is modified, a system call  execution completes
       and ends up invoking scheduler - do you expect any 
       change in the scheduler ?? during sensitive code like
       scheduler, hw interrupts are disabled !! there will 
       change in the scheduler with respect to hw context 
       restoration - since hw context restoration is now
       done using system stack, that part of the code will 
       change - scheduling policy related code will not be 
       changed, since it does not depend on hw context saving !!!
       context restoration is based the latest hw context 
       maintained by this process, in the system stack !!!
       in addition, other house keeping activities are done - 
       basically, certain clean-up !!!

     - to understand this model, let us understand what happens
       when an interrupt is generated while the process
       is executing in system space - the details are below :
      
        - when system call API is executed, sa1 is used 
          to save user-space context 
        - further, when interrupt occurs, sa2 is used to 
          save system space context 
        - lastsa of the pd is updated accordingly 
        - at the end of interrupt handler(any interrupt handler)
          scheduler is invoked !!! this is a normal convention 
          in most sensible operating systems !!!
        - scheduler will use the lastsa info to access sa2 and
          restore the context - this will resume execution of the 
          process in system call system routine   
        - what happens when system call system routine finishes 
          its work and invokes the scheduler ?? sa1 will be used
          to restore the context of user-space of the process and
          resume execution in user-space !!! in addition, 
          insystem variable is decremented to 0 !!!

       - to understand blocking of a system call, let us understand
         what happens when a process is blocked inside a system call
         , in this model !!!
            - let us assume that a process is attempting to receive
              a message from a message queue and there is no message
            - typically, the process is blocked in the waitqueue
              of the message queue
                 - message queue is an operating system mechanism - 
                   it is used to exchange data between processes
                   - message queues are accessed using system call 
                     APIs - tx message and rx message system call APIs 
            - in addition, switch process routine is invoked !!!

            - switch process is responsible for saving 
              hw context(state of registers of processor ) 
              such that the process will resume 
              from the system call system routine after 
              switch process routine - this is a conventional
              way of blocking a process and saving its context !!!
            - in this scenario, saving context is done 
              by saving r31 and psw, not iia and ipsw - 
              r31 is saved such that when the process is resumed
              after wake-up, it will execute in system space 
              after switch process routine's code - psw is 
              saved such that processor state is restored 
              to that of system space execution !!!
            - this is a good example of saving process context 
              , without an interrupt/system call API 
            - when will this process be woken-up and what will 
              happen when this process is woken up ???  
            - this process will be woken when a message arrives
              in this message queue and invariably that is 
              the responsibility of another system call API executed
              by another process !!!
            - it is also the responsibility of that system call 
              to add the message and wake-up any process that 
              is blocked for a message !!!
            - a system call API may be responsible for blocking 
              a process , if a resource or a message is not 
              available !!! a system call API may be responsible
              for waking up a process as well !!! after wake-up,
              process is added to ready state !!! sometime in the
              future, scheduler will schedule this process based
              on its merit !!
            - when the scheduler schedules this process in the 
              future,saved  hw context of this process is restored -
              when it is restored, this process will resume execution
              in the same system call, after switch process routine !!!


11. we can use the understanding of ch6 to understand 2 more 
    features - user-space preemption and system-space preemption - 
    we can also understand the benifits of a fully preemptive
    system vs a partially preemptive  system !!!
     - fully preemptive system - it supports user-space preemption 
       and system space preemption 
     - partially preemptive system - it only supports user-space 
       preemption !! 
     - userspace preemption - if a process is preempted when 
       it is executing in user-space, we say that the preemption
       is user-space preemption 
     - system space preemption - if a process is preempted when 
       it is executing in system space, we say that the preemption 
       is sytem space preemption !!
     - as per class diagram on system space preemption, following 
       are the conclusions:

         - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 is the sequence of execution 
           flow, if system space preemption is not supported
           in the operating system or system space preemption 
           is disabled, currently !!! 
         
         - 1 -> 2  -> 6 is the sequence of execution 
           flow, if system space preemption is supported
           in the operating system or system space preemption 
           is enabled , currently !!!

         - in short, it is understood that a system that supports
           system space preemption honours rescheduling immediately
           and this improves responsiveness of a system !!!
         - in a system that does not support system space preemption,
           rescheduling is honoured after  a delay or latency - 
           this degrades responsiveness of a system !! we will
           see more of this during scheduling !!!
