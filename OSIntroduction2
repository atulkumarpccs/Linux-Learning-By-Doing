1. core of the operating system is typically known as kernel 

2. kernel is made of several core components of an operating system 

3. kernel typically resides in kernel space of the system

4. non-core components of an OS are typically located in 
   user-space system - in addition, applications also 
   reside in user-space of the system !!

5. kernel is made of several components - some of the important components
   are listed below:
    - hardware abstraction layer(HAL)
    - device drivers 
    - process manager
    - physical memory manager
    - virtual memory manager
    - scheduler(s)
    - ipc manager
    - interrupt manager
    - logical file manager
    - different file system managers
    - time management subsystem 
    - I/O management subsystems 
    - and other long list of specific components


6. what is the role of HAL ??
    - this is the component that is responsible for architecture 
      specific features of a hardware platform of a computing system 
    - in fact, any other component of the operating system must 
      go thru. HAL to interact with any part of h/w platform !!!
    - if an OS is implemented on different h/w platforms, HAL 
      is different in each case - in short, OS is built with 
      a different HAL for a different h/w platform !!1  
    - this layer of the OS is written and implemented using 
      architecture specific machine instructions - meaning, 
      this layer is written using low-level language, not 
      high-level language, typically !!!

7. device drivers are part of the kernel/kernel-space that 
   typically enable operating system and applications to 
   access peripheral devices !!!

8. apart from HAL and device drivers, there are several other
   components - many of them can be spotted in the previous
   points, above 

9. in addition, there is one special layer/component in the
   kernel known as system call interface layer - this layer
   along with system libraries is responsible for implementing
   and accessing system call(s) of the kernel / operating system 
   - it is via system call(s) that core services of any 
   operating system are made available to user-space/ applications

10.memory regions containing kernel components are together known
   as kernel - space - do not assume that a contiguous physical 
   memory region is assigned to kernel - space - several 
   non-contiguous memory regions may be logically put together
   to form the kernel space !!! a special attribute may be
   enabled for the memory regions associated with kernel space

11.memory regions containing non core components of the operating
   system and applications are together known as user-space !!!
   - do not assume that a contiguous physical memory region
   is assigned to users-space - several non contiguous regions
   may put together - a special attribute may not be set for 
   the memory regions associated with user-space !!!

12.since the core services of operating system are exported 
   via system calls/system call APIs, user-space components/applications
   can access kernel services only via system calls/system callAPIs - 
   if user-space components/applications attempt to access 
   core services of the operating system by bypassing system call 
   APIs, processor will generate an exception - invariably, this
   exception will terminate the user-space process that attempted
   direct access of kernel services !!!
         - typically system call APIs are provided via 
           system libraries 
         - system call APIs may be used by other libraries
           , applications and utilities, as needed !!!

         - can we say that all the core services are exported
           via system call APIs ??? No - not all services
           are exported via system callAPIs

         - can you name one or more services offered by the
           operating system, but not available via system call
           APIs ???
             - there are certain services exported by the 
               operating system via system APIs, which are
               available for access only by system space
               components - these are not available to 
               use space components !!!


13. in the above case, why should the processor generate an 
    exception ???  
    - in most modern operating systems, processors used are
      sophisticated - meaning, processors support a priviliged
      mode of operation and less priviliged mode of operation- 
      in the priviliged mode of operation, a processor can 
      access entire set of memory regions in the system - 
      meaning, user-space and system-space 

    - when a processor is working is less priviliged mode
      of operation, a processor can access only part of
      the entire set of memory regions - meaning, user-space
      part only !!!   
 
    - it is partly the responsibilty of operating system 
      to force the processor to work in priviliged mode, 
      when kernel components are executing on the processor 

    - it is partly the responsibility of operating system 
      to force the processor to execute in less priviliged
      mode when user-space components and applications are
      executing on the processor !!!
 
    - kernel space components have unlimited access/priviliges
      to h/w components subject to the rules of the operating
      system 

    - user-space components/applications must access h.w. resources
      only via core services - subject to the rules of operating 
      system !!!

14. system call APIs and system call system routines !!!

    - what is so special about system call APIs, compared to 
      other APIs ??
        - system call APIs are implemented using 
          special machine instructions - we discuss more
          about these machine instructions, when we 
          discuss about interrupts and also during 
          system call assignment !!!

    - user-space components and applications may access h.w.
      components and other core services via system call APIs - 
      how is this implemented ??
             - refer to os_intro11.txt and also certain 
               sample code used during system call assignments !!

    - what is a system call system routine ?? 
      - different components provide different services and 
        may be responsible for providing one or more 
        system call services as well - although system call
        APIs are implemented in user-space system libraries, 
        system call system routines are actually implemented
        in different components of the kernel space - there
        is a one to one mapping between user-space system 
        call APIs and system space system call routines !!
      - the actual work is done in the system call system 
        routines, system call APIs are mainly helpful  
        in invoking the appropriate system call system routine!!!
      - to get a complete picture of system call APIs, one needs
        to understand the working of interrupts - interrupt mechanism
        is also used to implement system calls 

      - how many system call APIs/system call system routines
        may exist in the system ??
        - may be 100s of such APIs - the exact no. varies
          from operating system to operating system - also
          depends on version of an operating system !!!  
    
      - what are their typical uses ???  meaning, what the 
        services offered via system call APIs - this is the 
        meaning of exporting core services via system call APIs !!            
        - process creation, process termination, thread creation/
          termination, I/O access, memory allocation/deallocation,
          synchronization, data-exchange, tuning scheduler
          parameters, file I/O access , network I/O and many more !!!  

        - many operating system parameters may need system call APIs!!!

15. h.w interrupt mechanism - this is highly h/w dependent and
    also architecture dependent - still, we will try to understand
    for our purpose by ignoring certain details of h/w - we 
    will see further details when we look into certain 
    pseudo code implementation of operating system components !!

    - whenever a h.w interrupt signal is generated, the following 
      sequence of actions are taken by the processor and 
      followed by operating sytem actions :
       - typically peripheral hw controllers or hw timer controller
         generate hw interrupts directed to the processor 
       - processor responds by taking one or more actions 
       - processor may save certain critical registers' state-
         current information of registers - on stack memory 
         - we will see more details later !!
       - processor may switch its current privilige mode of 
         operation - say, less priviliged mode of operation
         to priviliged mode of operation - when there is an 
         interrupt event, processor's control register
         responsible for privilige setting will be modified
         , implicitly !!!
       - processor may jump to a predefined routine in 
         system space - such a routine is known as interrupt 
         handler - several interrupt handlers for managing 
         several hw interrupts are managed in the system's
         interrupt table !!! 
       - typically, base address of the interrupt table is 
         maintained in a control register of the processor - 
         it is the responsibility of the operating system to 
         initialize the processor's control registers such 
         that processor is enable to handle hw events 
         consistently !!! OS must also be responsible for
         initializing the interrupt table !!!
          - interrupt table is part of interrupt manager,
            in system space !!!
          - where are the interrupt handlers located ??
              -located in system - space - which components
               /subsystems contain interrupt handlers !!!
                  - I/O subsystems and device drivers !!!
  
      - once interrupt handling is completed by the respective
        interrupt handler, following actions may be taken - 
        currently, interrupt handler is treated as a single 
        routine - in reality, it may be a chain of routines - 
        we will understand more of it later !!1
        - once interrupt handling is completed, a special 
          machine instruction is executed 
        - this instruction typically does the reverse of 
          what interrupt signal initiated - meaning, 
          processor's privilige mode is restored to 
          less priviliged mode - original context/state of 
          processor's  registers are restored - processor
          is forced to jump back to user-space instruction 
          in the interrupted process !!!
        
        - 3 parts in interrupt handling 
              - first part is actions, when an interrupt signal 
                is generated 
              - executing ISR/interrupt handler
              - return from interrupt handling using 
                special machine instruction !!!


       - hw interrupts typically do the following :

         - whenever there is a h/w interrupt, corresponding 
           interrupt handler is invoked/serviced
         - interrupt handler may do the following:
            - service a h/w peripheral controller
            - service a kernel subsystem  - one such 
              subsystem is scheduler - another such subsystem
              is networking and many more !!!
            - indirectly service an application which 
              is dependent on a h/w peripheral controller or
              a kernel subsystem !!!

16. kernel components are typically passive entities loaded in 
    system space and exist through the life of the system - 
    a component or a routine in a component is invoked, when 
    user-space invokes a system call API or a h/w interrupt is
    generated and action is taken - this implies that kernel components 
    are not processes or threads, typically - they execute as part
    of interrupt handling or as an extension to user-space processes !!!
    - however, there may be exceptions - we will see such cases, in 
    appropriate contexts !!!
       - why should user-space applications/components invke
         system call APIs ???
              - file I/O 
              - network I/O
              - application launching
              - memory allocation 
              - access USB modem
              - creating a file system on a disk partition !!!    
              - it may be directly or indirectly !!!most 
                core services are offered via system call APIs
                - you may use them directly or indirectly via 
                  libraries or indirectly via  utilities - 
                  libraries and utilities may end up calling 
                  system call APIs 
       - what happens, if system call APIs are invoked ??? 

17. as mentioned above, system calls are implemented using 
    interrupt mechanism - a specific machine instruction of 
    the processor is used to generate an interrupt - a specific
    entry in the  interrupt  table is reserved for corresponding 
    system call interrupt handler - every system call API uses
    the same specific machine instruction - the end result is 
    a special jump to the same system call interrupt handler -
    in addition, following actions are also taken :
       - each system call API uses a different set of parameters
         and these parameters are passed to system space via 
         processor registers 

       - one such parameter defines the identity of a system 
         call API - this parameter is known as system call no. 
        
       - system call interrupt handler is programmed such that 
         it interprets the system call no. and invokes appropriate
         system call system routine !!       

       - each system call API is associated with a specific
         system call system routine - system call interrupt handler
         invokes the appropriate system call system routine 
         with the help of system call no. - system call table
         maintains system call routine addresses !!!
  
       - where are the system call routines actually located 
         , in system space ??? several hundreds of system call
         routines are located in various different subsystems
         and their components !!!
  
       - once a system call system routine is executed, it will 
         return to the system call interrupt handler, which 
         uses a special machine instruction to jump back to the
         process and resume its execution in user-space !!! 
  
       - during the first jump from user-space to system-space 
         and return jump to user-space, most steps are same 
         as in the case of a h/w interrupt handling !!!  

       - many of the parameters are passed to system call system 
         routine - based on the parameters, system call system 
         routine will do appropriate service or resource allocation 
         
       - various system call system routines, are implemented
         in different subsystems of the kernel space !!!


18. one of the common h/w interrupt sources is timer h/w controller- 
    in most systems, this controller is programmed to generate 
    h/w interrupts, periodically !!! these h/w interrupts invoke
    timer interrupt handler - timer interrupt handler is tightly 
    coupled with cpu scheduler of the system - invariably, 
    time-sharing/time-slicing based scheduling require timer
    interrupt handler's service !!! timer interrupt handler is also
    used to service other subsystems of the kernel !!!
