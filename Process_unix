1. the basic system call API is fork() - it is used to create a 
   new, duplicate process as that of the parent process - the parent process
   and the child process are said to be executing 2 different instances
   of the same program/application - in fact, that is the reason for creating 
   a duplicate process - new process is said to be the child process of th e
   creating, parent process
        - why do we need to create a new process, in the system - as
          a developer what do you gain ???
            - to launch a new application !!!
            - an isolated execution environmnet which provides
              its own set of resources and threads !!!
            - normally, a new process will launch a new application - 
              normally, a new process will be assoicated with 
              a new application - different from that of parent process !!!
            - fork() is a system call API that creates a new process which 
              executes another instance of the same program/application 
              as that of its parent !!! - this is very different from a 
              normal process creation system call API - this is also 
              a peculiarity of Unix/Linux !!!

        - why does the system need to create a new process ???
             - for the same reasons mentioned above - to provide
               an isolated execution env for applications !!!
                  - fairly independent address spaces 
                  - meaning, own address space and other control 
                             parameters !!!!

         - for a new application to be launched in any system,a new
           process must be created and a new application must be 
           loaded into that process !!! how this is achieved, varies
           from one operating system to another - in the case of Unix/Linux,
           fork() is used to create a new process and exec() family of 
           calls are used to load a new application !!!
               - depending on the operating system you work on,
                 you may need 2 steps or just one step - 
                 you may have to use 2 system call APIs or 
                 one system call API !!
               - in the case of Unix/Linux or similar system 
                 you may have to use 2 system call APIs to 
                 achieve this !!!

         


2. duplication is done as below:
    - a new pd is created with most of the fields copied from the parent -
      typically, credentials are copied - scheduling policy, scheduling 
      parameter, user id and many more are duplicated - other fields are
      modified as needed - say, pid (process id) , ppid(parent process id) 
      and other accounting info. are modified/reset 
    - a new set of VADs are created and their contents are duplicated from 
      the parent process !!! meaning, virtual address space of the child  
      is same as that of parent process - this is also a key aspect 
      in duplication - still, the parent and the child process will 
      be executing the same program, but different instances !!!
    - a new set of page tables are created based on the VADs 
    - ptes of the child process are duplicated from the ptes of the parent 
      process - in short, page-frames are shared, but in read only mode -
        meaning, now, child process and parent process are sharing the
        same set of page frames, but in read only mode, even if they 
        are supposed to be set to r/w mode as per the VAD permissions !!!
        - further, parent and child processes are sharing page frames
          in ready only mode - this is a special case - now, try to 
          understand what is given below :
    - when a child process or parent process attempts to access a virtual 
      page/address is read mode, access is normally completed 
    - if a child process or parent process attempts to access a virtual 
      page/address in write mode, access is leads to generation of a
      page-fault due to permission error 
    - if a page-fault occurs in this scenario, system verifies the validity
      of the virtual address and its original permissions as mentioned in the
      VADs of the respective process !!!
    - original permissions for a r/w page/page-frame will r/w in VAD, but 
      r only in pte of the process - it is the responsibility of the 
      page fault exception handler to differentiate these scenarios and 
      take appropriate action 
    - if a permission related page fault occurs and the original permissions
      do not support writing(VAD permissions), process will be terminated 
          - meaning, pte has r permissions and VAD has rw permissions 
          - in this case, operating system will terminate the 
            process abnormally !!!

    - if a permission related page fault occurs and the original permissions
      do support writing, process will not be terminated - it will be provided
      a new page-frame and the contents of the shared page-frame are duplicated  
      in the new page-frame - the pte corresponding to the new, duplicated
      page frame is now set to original permissions - meaning, rw, which is 
      the same as that of the VAD - meaning, original permissions of th e
      VAD are passed on to the ptes !!! 
      such a mechanism is known as copy-on-write 
      mechanism - this is popular in Unix/Linux and other systems as well !!! 
               - this is nothing but deferred duplication of 
                 page frames 
               - once again, this is an implementation based approach
               - once again, this is done to use page frames efficiently !!!
               - this minimizes overheads /latencies during process
                 creation 
               - this increases overheads/latencies during run time 
                 of the process
               - in a GPOS, run time overheads/latencies are ok ,
                 but may not be  ok with respect to RTOS systems !!! 

    - this is a form of deferred duplication of page-frames - it leads to 
      efficient usage of page-frames- text / code /read only areas will 
      never be duplicated !!! by this technique, certain page frames will 
      never be duplicated - meaning, they will be permanently shared between
      processes which use shared code /libraries !!!
    - in addition, new pd is also provided other objects and resources !!
    - one such resource is kernel -stack - kernel stack contents of the 
      child process are duplicated from the parent process with some subtle 
      changes !!!
    - since, most of the memory contents are duplicated from the parent process,
      execution context of the parent process is also duplicated for the 
      child process !!!
                  - in the above mechanim, most of the memory areas of 
                    user-space of a parent process is duplicated for 
                    the child process - this includes execution context 
                    due to duplication of user-space stack and duplication
                    of system space stack !!!
                  - child starts with a new execution environment, but 
                    current excecution  context state of the parent process is 
                    used by the child !!! this is based on the fact that 
                    child process has duplicated its execution context 
                    from the parent process !!!

    - the parent process completes fork() system call and returns to user-space
      to continue execution - as part of the rules of fork(), fork() returns
      a +ve value when the parent process returns back to user-space - +ve
      value represents pid of the child process just created !!
    - if fork() system call fails due to resource constraints or other rules
      of the system, it will return -1 and pass an error in errno variable
      of the library !!!
    - newly created child process/pd is currently added to the ready queue
      (we will see more of this during assignments) and will be waiting 
      for its turn to be scheduled by the scheduler 
    - scheduler will schedule the new process some time in the future !!!
      assuming our child process gets scheduled, it will resume its execution 
      after fork() by returning 0 - it is the responsibility of the developer to
      check the return value to find whether parent process is the current process
      or child process is the current process !!1
       - if parent starts after fork(), it is acceptable as per normal 
         coding conventions 
       - if we say that the duplicate child process also starts after fork(),
         how do we justify the behaviour - this is practically true !!!


    - based on the above, different code sections of the same program/application
      will be executed by the parent process and child process !!!
     
    - scheduler will schedule the new process some time in the future !!!
      assuming our child process gets scheduled, it will resume its execution 
      after fork() by returning 0 - it is the responsibility of the developer to
      check the return value to find whether parent process is the current process
      or child process is the current process !!1
    - based on the above, different code sections of the same program/application

      for its turn to be scheduled by the scheduler

    - based on the above, different code sections of the same program/application
      will be executed by the parent process and child process !!!

3. fork() is a peculiar system call used to create a duplicate process 
   in Unix/Linux - a few system calls like these are peculiar in unix/linux - 
   once your cross these, unix/linux is very practical - in other systems, 
   fork() and similar peculiarities do not exist - rest of everything is 
   peculiar 

4. fork() is fairly useless without other system call APIs - we need 
   other system calls - one such system call API is execve() - execve() 
   system call does the following :
Note: objective of execl() and family of calls is simple - load/launch
      a new application/program within an existing process - typcially,
      this is done within a newly created child process using fork()- 
      do note that execl() does not create a new process- it uses
      an existing process to accomplish what the developer wants !!!


   - it destroys the current process virtual address space - meaning, 
     VADs are freed 
   - it destroys page frames of the current process - meaning, freed 
   - it destroys page-tables - meaning, freed 
   - otherwise, most of the other objects and characteristics of the 
     process are retained via pd and other objects - for example,
     pid,ppid,credentials, scheduling policy/priority and many other
     are retained !!!  
   - a new set of VADs are created based on the newly loaded application/
     program - the contents of the VADs are initialized based on the 
     information provided by program header file and rules of the process
     memory manager !! in addition, during run-time, additional VADs are
     created and filled as per dynamic memory requirements - for example,
     heap, dynamic stack expansion, anonymous memory allocations,dynamic libraries
     and many more !!!
   - as per the VADs, a new set of page tables are created and associated
     with the process - in addition, ptes of the new page-tables are initialized
     to invalid state
   - old execution context is no longer used - a new execution context is created 
   - a new, fresh context is created for the newly loaded application and
     control is passed to the scheduler- scheduler resumes the same child 
     process with the newly available execution context - using this, a jump
     is executed to the entry point of the new application, in user-space -
     the new application starts executing in the same child process !!!!
         - system stack is overwritten with new hw context for 
           resuming the main() of the new program in user-space !!!


   - execution context and code/data/heap/stack of old application in the 
     child process are completely destroyed - no longer available !!! 

   - only time execve() or execl() will return to the same application/code
     of the current process is when execve() or execl() fails to load 
     a new application in the current process !!! meaning, the only time 
     execv()/execvl() or family of calls will return is when there
     is error in completing execv()/execl()/family of calls !!!

   - if you have understood the working of execve(), execl() works the 
     same way - just that execl() has a different syntax and easy to use
     compared to execve() !!! 
 
   - most common scenario is that a new, duplicate process is created using 
     fork() system call API and in the child process, execve() like system call
     API is used to destroy the current program's VAS and associated memory - 
     followed by this, a new set of VADs and associated memory will be allocated
     for the newly loaded program !!!
   - in short, fork() followed by execve() can yield a new process with a 
     new program/ application loaded, in it !!  
   - execve() is seldom used directly - instead, execl() or execv() APIs 
     built on top of execve() are used, actually !!
   - execve() is a powerful system call API which will ensure appropriate
     libraries are loaded as per the requirement of a program or application 
     by reading the header information of the file !! in fact, these are
     the internal implementation of execve() system call !!
   - after execve() or related system call API is executed, previous
     code resident in the process is destroyed and never executed !!
     this is a feature that students are seldom comfortable with !!!
      - this means, any code written after execl() or execve() or
        similar API,will never be executed - execl() or execve() will
        never return to the original program, if successful - after 
        execl()/execve(), execution of user-space code of this process
        resumes from main() of the program or application !!! 

      - one possible mistake is following ;

                   linei   - ret = execl(); //some application is loaded
                   linei+1 - ret = execl(); //some other application is loaded 
         - linei+1 will never execute if first execl() succeeds !!!

      - one more possible mistake is following :
                   linei - ret = execl(); //load some application
                   linei+1 - printf(); //diagnostic message 

          - linei+1 will never get executed, if linei is successful !!!!



   - for example, if you are using execl(), following are the key points:
             ret = execl(param1,param2,param3,param4,param5,....,NULL);

             - param1 must be the pathname of the application that 
               must be loaded/launched in the current process !!!
             - for standard utilities and binaries, use "which" or 
               "whereis -b" to locate them 
             - which scans all directories included in PATH environment 
               variable !!!
             - whereis -b scans standard directories of the system - 
               it will list all such binaries found in all the standard
               directories - we have to make a well informed decision - 
               for which, we must known more about standard directories
               and binaries !!! refer to shell related pdf of day1 !!!
             - if the binary/application is a non-standard , custom 
               binary, we cannot use which and whereis -b, if such 
               a binary is not located in standard directories - 
               we must pass the actual pathname based on our understanding !!!

             - param2 is quite simple - just pass the name of the binary
               or application - this is needed for the execl() as per 
               rules of unix/linux process !!!
             
             - from param3 to paramn, number of parameters and the value
               passed for the paramters is decided by the binary/application
               that  we are launching(param1/param2), not by execl()
             - you must end execl() with a NULL - this means, no more
               parameters are present - this is a subtle implementation 
               syntax !!! 

             - execl() will never return any value, if it is successful 
               , in launching a binary, in the current process !!!
                - for example, some think that it returns a +ve value
                  , when it is successful !!! this is wrong !!!
             - execl() returns only when there is error and the return
               value will be  -1 !!!
                      - possibility of an error is in wrong parameters
                        - invalid parameters !!!
  
             - execv() is just a more convenient form of execl() - 
               in fact, both end up using execve() !!!
                  - syntax of execv is :
                       ret = execv(param1,param2);

                  - param1 is same as that of execl()
                  - param2 is a pointer to an array - array of
                    pointers - in fact, each element in the array
                    is nothing but param2 to paramn and NULL that 
                    was passed to execl() as a list !!
                  - whether to use execl() or execv() is left to 
                    the developer !!!
                  - rule of ret value are same as that of execl()  

             - what about execlp() ???
                  - only difference between execl() and execlp() is 
                    that latter can use just the name of the binary 
                    in the first parameter - otherwise, execl() and
                    execlp() are one and the same !!!
                  - how does this work ??
                     - every process in unix/linux contains a dedicated
                       area in the stack segment of the process for 
                       storing program variables and environment 
                       variables !!!
                     - one env. variable stored in environment variables
                       area is PATH 
                     - this is true for every process - this includes
                       shell process (in our case, bash processes) -
                       shell uses PATH environment variable extensively
                       - other applications may also use such environment
                         variables - you will come across more with 
                         experience !!!
                     - execlp() and many other system calls may also 
                       use PATH environment variable of current process !!!
                     - if a new child process is created using fork(),
                       child process inherits environment variables of 
                       parent process !!! after fork(), we may end up 
                       calling execl(), in the child !! execl() continues
                       to inherit env variables of the current process,
                       even if it loads a new application !!!  
                     - execve() may be used to change the entire set 
                       of env variables of the current process, when 
                       a newly loaded application is being executed !!!
                - second parameter of execl() or execve(), is peculiar -
                  here, we pass the name of the binary, whose pathname
                  is passed as first parameter !!! what is the significance
                  of the second parameter, in execl() ???
                      - param2 of execl() /execve() is passed as 
                        argv[0] to the main() of the application 
                        that is launched by execl() or execve() !!!
                      - in most cases, this may not be used by the
                        application - that is not our concern - whether
                        they use or not, we must follow the rules !!!
                      - in unix/linux, using argv[0] is very popular 
                        among many utilities - it is an unix tradition 
                        - we will see more of this during file system 
                          discussion !!!           
                      - if argv[0] is used by an application, what may 
                        be the use of param1 of execl()/execve() ???
                            - execl() or execve() uses param1 !!!
                              execl() and execve() are also known 
                              as loaders - they invoke appropriate 
                              loading of application file from the
                              filesystem and interpreting the contents !!!

 
5. when you execute a program or command on the shell prompt, what happens ??
   meaning, with respect to process creation and loading the application ??
   - if the shell recognizes the command as internal command(built-in command), 
     it will just execute certain code to accomplish the functionality
   - on the other hand, if the command is an external command, 
     shell invokes a fork() and follows it with an execl() by passing 
     appropriate program pathname and any parameters !!
         - who is responsible for creation of a process , here - meaning 
           fork() invokation ???
         - who is responsible for launching a new application - meaning,
           execl() /execv() invokation ???

6. following are some of the characteristics if a Linux process and
   we will be needing these during practical understanding and coding :
  
   - in a linux system, task may be a process or a thread of a process -
     in our current discussions, task is an user-space  process !!!
     in the future, there will be many other entities that may be 
     treated as process !!!
 
   - a typical linux process may be in one of the following states:
Note: linux process states are subtly different from theoretical 
      process states, but versatile !!! 
           TASK_RUNNING       - ready state or running state 
                              - a running process is identified using 
                                current !!!current is a special macro 
                                in system space - cannot be accessed 
                                from user-space !!!
           TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE - most common blocked state / waiting state
                              - if a process is blocked in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE 
                                state, it may be forcibly woken up using 
                                a unix signal mechanism  - a process may 
                                also be woken up, if an unix signal is generated
                                for the process !!!what happens after a wake-up 
                                due to an unix signal, is a long story - we will
                                see it below !!!

                              - what is the difference between waking normally 
                                and waking up forcibly ???
                                    - refer to process.txt for more 
                                      details !!!

                              - why do we need such facilities ???

                                    -meaning, why do we need forcible wake up 
                                     facilities like signals !!!
                                    - if a process is blocked, but unable 
                                     to wake up normally, system provides 
                                     a mechanim that can enable the developer/
                                     administrator to forcibly wake up a 
                                     process !!!!


           TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE - less common blocked state / waiting state 
                                - if a process is blocked in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
                                  state, it cannot be forcibly woken up using 
                                  a unix signal mechanism - only when th e
                                  appropriate event occurs, process will be 
                                  woken-up - this predemoninantly used for 
                                  I/O blocking, where premature wakeup may 
                                  lead to loss of data and inconsistent data !!!
             
           Note: as a user-space developer, we do not have much control over the
                 above - as a system space developer, we can control the above
                 states !!! refer to manual page of "ps" command for more   
                 details !!!
                  

           TASK_STOPPED         -  a process may be forcibly stopped(not terminated/
                                   not blocked) - to stop process, a unix signal 
                                   mechanism must be used - to resume the process
                                   a unix signal mechanism must be used 
           Note: there are several unix signals in unix signal mechanism - one
                 such is SIGSTOP(stopping) and another such is SIGCONT(continue/
                 resume a process) 
           Note: this is not same as blocking !!! this is more of 
                  unconditional blocking and will be woken up only 
                  by a signal !!! 



           TASK_ZOMBIE          - 
                                  this is the terminated state, where all the resources
                                  are freed - meaning, resources and assoicated 
                                  data structures are freed, but pd is still retained - this is a peculiar process state that is used in Linux/unix systems !!! there are
special system calls and macros to extract info. from a terminated process and investigate further !!! it is useful for developers and may not be useful for others !!  
                         
           TASK_DEAD            - this is a transitional state, which cannot be seen -
                                  exits for too short a time for humans - a process
                                  in TASK_ZOMBIE state will be moved to this state 
                                  when pd is also freed - meaning, when the process
                                  is completely destroyed - when a process is completely
                                  destroyed, it will be removed from every list 
                                  in the system - that is the reason , we will be 
                                  unable to see it !!! for a process to move from 
                                  TASK_ZOMBIE to TASK_DEAD, parent of the process
                                  must clean-up the corresponding child process 
                                  using waitpid() system call API - 
                                  that is one of the reasons why waitpid() is 
                                  invoked by parent process to do the clean-up of
                                  a terminated child process - during clean-up 
                                  pd of the terminated child process is freed !!!
 
        - if a parent process has several children processes,it is the responsibility of the parent process to invoke waitpid() system call API several times using
   proper techniques - it is a good convention to do so and clean up terminated 
   children processes - otherwise, terminated children processes may exist 
   in ZOMBIE state and waste resources !!! in any case, if you need to know 
   the termination status of the child process, waitpid() is a must !!! 
        - to manage the above states, system supports several mechanisms and 
          associated system call APIs 
        - one such mechanism is unix signals 
        - another mechanism is cleaning up zombie processes by using 
          certain system call APIs
        - how does a process enter zombie state ?? 
                - abnormal termination - one way of abnormal termination
                  is using kill command or kill() system call API !!
                  pkill may also be used !!! do see the man pages 
                  of kill / pkill / kill() !!! 
                - pkill helps to terminate all instances of a misbehaving
                  application - meaning, we can use name of application 
                  and not PID !!!
                - any other mechanism to terminate a process ???
                     - exit() or _exit() or return should be used
                       for normal termination of a process
                     - if you end up calling return in your process,
                       it will return from main() to the library and
                       library will in turn call exit() - it is still 
                       preferred to call exit() from our program to 
                       keep things simple !!!
                     - ideally, exit() is preferred - use others
                       if you know what you are doing !!!           


7. normal termination of a process - following is the description of 
   normal termination of a process:
     - any process that terminates using exit() or _exit() APIs
       is known to be normally terminated !!
     - exit() is a library call that executes _exit() and is 
       popularly used 
     - _exit() is a system call API which may be used alone or
       by indirectly executing exit()
     - do refer to man 3 exit and man 2 exit for more details !!
       these are manual pages that will provide more details as required !!! 
     - exit() is the most commonly used API - if exit(0) is invoked, 
       it means the process terminated normally after completing its work !!!
     - exit(n) - n!=0 means the process terminated normally, but did 
       not complete its work !!
     - the above can be found in the shell's behaviour - if a command is 
       executed and there is a normal / successful termination, shell 
       will capture the return value from the process and return to the 
       developer/user 
     - in the shell's case, if there is a normal / unsuccessful termination, 
       shell will capture the +ve error code from the process and return 
       to the developer/user 

     - when a process is terminated normally, its resources are freed, but 
       pd is still retained - the state of the process is set to 
       TASK_ZOMBIE - in addition, the exit code passed to exit() by the
       terminating process is stored as part of pd 

     - it is typically the responsibility of a parent process to clean-up 
       the child process and retrieve the exit() code of the child process - 
       the parent process may investigate the exit() code of the child process
       ,if needed !!!

     - for cleaning up a child process, a parent process must invoke wait() 
       or waitpid() system call API - waitpid() is a preferred system call API -
       wait() is not !!! meaning, waitpid() is a more advanced system call API
       over wait() - wait() is an older system call API - waitpid() provides
       more options and flexibility compared to wait() - otherwise, both
       have the responsibility of cleaning up child(ren) processes !!!
     - read the manual pages of wait() and waitpid() for more details !!!
    
     - when waitpid() is invoked, a parent will do the following : 

        - if the child process is terminated and in zombie state, 
          parent process will clean-up child process by freeing the 
          child process pd - also the exit() code of the child process
          returned to parent via "status" field passed to waitpid() call !!! 
        - if the child process is not in terminated state(not in zombie state), 
          the parent process
          will be blocked inside waitpid() system call API - when the child process
          terminates in the future, it will wake-up the parent process and 
          also send a SIGCHLD signal to the parent process !!! a blocked
          parent process is woken up when a child process is terminated 
          and system does a wakeup of its pd !!!  meaning, waitpid() is a
          blocking system call API and must be used carefully !!!
        - when the parent process is woken-up, it will resume its execution 
          from waitpid() and complete the clean-up of the child process
          - waitpid() will return a +ve value, if it has cleaned up a 
            child process !!! +ve value will be that of the pid of 
            the cleaned up child process !!!
        - if a parent process has several children processes, it is the 
          responsibility of the parent process to invoke waitpid() several 
          times to clean-up the child process - this will be clear when we
          practically discuss about waitpid() system call API !! 
        - waitpid() system callAPI returns a value - this is +ve, if 
          a terminated child process is cleaned up - waitpid() may also 
          return -1 - this means, there are no more children processes
          for this process in the system - using this value, a developer
          can interpret how to proceed after waitpid() returns - meaning,
          a developer may invoke waitpid() again and again or break out of
          the loop !!! 


8.  abnormal termination of a process - following are the possible scenarios
    for abnormal termination of a process :
        - a process can be forcibly terminated by the system or another process
          or some code !!!
        - when a process attempts certain illegal actions, system will 
          automatically generate certain specific signals to the process and 
          the process will be abnormally terminated - abnormal here means 
          process was not terminated using exit() or _exit() !!!
        - most common abnormal termination occurs due to illegal memory 
          access - NULL pointer access, invalid/unused virtual addresses,
          and insufficient access permissions to the particular virtual page
          /page frame !!! in all these cases, system will generate SIGSEGV	 
          signal to the offending process and the process will be terminated 
          abnormally !!!
                  - starting from 0x00000000, certain initial addresses
                    are unused by computing - it is a convention that 
                    must not be broken !!!
                  - all developers follow such conventions - starting 
                    from the system developers !!!
        - when there is an abnormal termination, process that terminates 
          enters zombie state and the abnormal termination code is stored 
          in the pd - in this sense,it is same as normal termination, but 
          the code stored is different !!!
        - in this case as well, waitpid() must be used to clean-up by 
          the parent process !!! the parent process may investigate, 
          if the child process terminated normally or abnormally !!!    
        - a process may also be forcibly terminated by another process/
          administrator using kill() system call or kill command !!!
                - in this case, it is just forcible termination !!!

9. unix/linux signals  
   - IPC means inter process communication - in real world, this means
     a lot more - process to process communication - process to process
     notification - process to process synchronization - system to process
     communication - system to process notification - thread to thread 
     communication - thread to thread notification - system to thread
     notification - system to thread communication - and many more !!! 

   - unix / linux signals come under IPC mechanisms that are used for 
     notification - notification can be process to process - notification 
     can be system to process - the details are described below :

   - unix/linux signals are primitive IPC mechanisms that enable notification
     to process - when a signal is generated, a bit in a bitmap field of th e
     process is set - several bits in the bitmap field of  a  process - 
     each bit signifies the occurence of a signal - a signal is generated 
     as a consequence of an event !! a typical event could be illegal 
     memory access or explicit notification by administrator or developer !!!
       - let us understand the signal pending field of a process - 
         this field has several bits - one per signal - in short, 
         a signal is represented by a bit in the signal pending field
         and the bit's position in the signal pending field acts as an
         identity of  a signal - in a typical linux system, there may 
         be 64 signals - which means, as many bits are present !!!
       - a particular signal of a process is said to be generated and pending,
         if the corresponding bit in the signal pending field of that
         process pd is set !!! this signal generation can be done
         by the system or by another process - if it is done by another
         process, it requires a system call API - kill() is the system 
         call API that does this job !!!  
         
   - if a signal is generated and is pending for a process, it is the 
     responsibility of the system to take appropriate action  
   - most common action taken by the system when a signal is generated for 
     a process is to terminate the process - this is the most common case,
     not the only case !!! there are other possible actions that we will
     discuss further, in other scenarios !!!

   - the list of all signals can be obtained from running the command
      "kill -l" from command line

   - some of the common signals that you may need immediately are as follows:

        - SIGSEGV (generated by the system )
           - this signal is generated by the system, when a process
             accesses illegal / unused virtual addresses - NULL pointer
             access comes under this - one more is when a process attempts
             to access a read only memory area for writing - say, if a process
             attempts to access code area for writing - this signal is 
             generated by page fault exception handler - system terminates
             the current process when this signal is generated !!!
           - events are typically illegal memory accesses !!! 
        - SIGTERM (generated from kill command)
           - SIGTERM may be generated using kill command and directed 
             to a process - it uses kill() system call API !!! 
           - administrator may generate - a developer may generate to 
             test his application !!! system generates SIGTERM signal,
             when system is about to shutdown !!! we will understand
             more about SIGTERM along with SIGKILL  
        - SIGINT  (generated using ctrl-c from command line or kill command)
            - what is the use of ctrl-c in a unix/linux system ?? 
              meaning, what does it do ???
              - in a unix/linux system, using ctrl-c a foreground 
                process/process group may be terminated - a foreground
                process/process group may be in ready queue, blocked or
                executing - still, we can use ctrl-c to terminate !!!
              - find out what does ctrl-z do ??
              - find out what does ctrl-\ do ??
            - if a ctrl-c is used, how does the system generate 
              SIGINT signal to appropriate forground process ???
              - assuming 5000 is the pgid of a such a foreground 
                process, how does the system know that in order 
                to generate a signal to that process ???
                  - unix/linux uses another concept known as 
                    terminal concept - terminal is an abstract
                    entity associated with every interactive shell - 
                    this terminal maintains info. - in that info,
                    foreground process/process group related info. 
                    are present !!! 
                  - there are several virtualized terminals in 
                    a unix/linux system - this is for the convenience
                    of users/developers/administrators !!
 
        - SIGKILL (generated using kill command)
               - to forcefully terminate a process - 
                 mainly, this is a fatal signal - meaning, it 
                 will definitely terminate a process - other signals
                 may also terminate a process, but they may not
                 definitely terminate the process - we will see more
                 details during signal handling mechanisms, below !!! 
               - system uses it during shutdown - system will first 
                 generate SIGTERM and then generate SIGKILL !!!
               - system generates SIGKILL for a set of processes
                 that are using a large amount of physical memory 
                 and system has entered low memory scenario !!! 

        - SIGSTOP (generated using kill command) 
               - may be used to unconditionally control a process
                 to stop and resume - this may be used by 
                 administrators or by system, if needed !!!
               - also used by debugging tools !!!

        - SIGCHLD (generated by the system )
               - in a unix/linux system, when a process terminates,
                 system generates SIGCHLD signal directed to its 
                 parent process !!!


        - SIGALRM (generated by the system ) 
               - a process can invoke a special system call such 
                 that system generates a SIGALRM signal after
                 a specified time out - this may be used to implement 
                 certain time-out conditions by developers !!! 
        - you may come across more signals and events during 
          other IPCs , networking and other subsystems !! 
        - apart from the other signals, there are certain signals
          which do not have a predefined event associated with 
          it !!! these signals are known as user defined signals 
          - in this category, there are a set of normal signals 
            and a set of real time signals 
          - refer to man 7 signal for more details !!!

   
   - a signal may be generated using kill command as below:
     
        "kill  -<SIGNALNAME>    <pid>" 
 
   - if a signal is generated for a process, the signal's action will 
     be taken by the system and it is asynchronous - in fact, most signals
     are asynchronous - meaning, a signal may be generated for a process 
     at any point of its code execution and action/delivery will also b e
     asynchronous with respect to its code execution !!! certain signals
     may be synchronous !!!
       - synchronous or asynchronous, action for a signal will be 
         taken by the system only when the repective process is 
         scheduled - this is a strict rule followed by the system !!!
       - you must clearly understand the meaning of asynchronous signals 
         vs synchronous signals !! what do you understand ???

       - a signal generation is synchronous, if the signal is generated
         at the same point of execution in the process, whenever the
         signal is generated !!!! in this case, a process must be 
         executing(running state) for a synchronous signal to be 
         generated !!!!
       - in the case of asynchronous signal, a process may or may not 
         be executing(running state), when an asynchronous signal 
         is generated !!! in the event that a process is blocked, 
         when an asynchronous signal is generated, system will 

       - what is the meaning of asynchronous signal action / signal delivery ???     
             - signal  may  not be delivered, when signal is generated !!!
             - signal action may be not taken at the same point of execution
               of the process, whenever action is taken for different 
               signal generation instances of the same signal type !!!
 
   - read man 2 waitpid()  for specific macros that may be used to verify 
     the type signal that abnormally terminated a child process  - this 
     technique will be needed in your assignments to test the exit code
     and termination of the child processes !! 

   - many of the processor exceptions are treated by the system as 
     fatal and in response, system will generate synchronous signals !!
     - these synchronous signals immediately lead to termination of the
       current process !!

   - let us assume a signal (typically an asynchronous signal is 
     generated for a process) - the signal will be set in the appropriate
     signal bit of the signal pending field of the process - this signal 
     will be pending as long as system does not have an oppportunity 
     to handle/take action for the respective signal - in most cases, 
     system will handle a pending signal, when the respective process
     invokes a system call and returns from a system call - meaning, after
     servicing the system call, system will check the pending signals just
     before restoring the user-space context of the process !!!
         - after a system call execution, system also invokes
           scheduler !! in addition, it may also take other actions-
           one such action is scanning for pending signals in the 
           current process !!! the meanning of this statement is that 
           whenever scheduler is invoked and it has decided to 
           schedule a selected process, it will not be able to 
           immediately resume the process in use-space - it has to 
           invoke signal handling code of the kernel space, complete
           any signal handling and eventually, resume the process, if 
           needed !!! such peculiarities are very common in operating 
           systems !!! you may need to understand , if required !!!
         - assumptions in the above case:
              - signal is typically asynchronous !!!
              - system is responsible for handling pending signal(s)
              - system will handle pending signals, when a process
                resumes from system space to user space - the above
                is one such instance - there can be several such 
                scenarios - you must be able to visualize !!!
              - in this case, process is said to be executing !!! 
         

   - the most common action taken by the system for a pending signal is
     termination of the process !!! such a common action is known as 
     default action of the system !! the action taken by the system 
     can be customized by modifying the settings in the signal action 
     table associated with a process !!! there is one entry per signal 
     in the signal action table of the process !!! using specific
     system call, a developer may change the settings of the signal 
     action table entry of a signal of a process !!! 
          - in this context, we will be using sigaction() to 
            fill a given entry in the signal action table !!!
          - whatever we pass via act1 is copied to appropriate 
            signal entry in the signal action table - this action 
            will be used, when a signal arrives some time in the 
            future !!!  

   - in addition, system also scans signal pending field of a process
     , when the process is interrupted by an interrupt/ISR and system 
     is resuming the process after interrupt handling - in short, it 
     is very similar to signal handling after a system call processing and
     just that this is interrupt processing !! otherwise, all the rules
     are the same !!!

   - let us assume a process is currently executing on the processor
     and system generates a signal !!! when will the system scan for
     pending signals and take appropriate action ???
        - there is a possibility that a hw interrupt may occur soon ??
          one such possible interrupt is timer interrupt - another
          possible interrupt is network interrupt - another possible
          interrupt is disk I/O and so on !!!
        - when such an interrupt completes processing and the current
          is being resumed, system will scan for pending signals  !!!
        - the above is just one possibility - it may be possible that
          the current process may have invoked a system call API just 
          after the signal was generated - it may or may not do so !!
          - if it has invoked  a system call API,  after completing 
          the system call API, system may scan the pending signals 
          and take appropriate action !!! 
               - depending upon which executes first, a system call API 
          may be responsible for a signal action or an interrupt handling
          may be responsible for interrupt action !!!!
        - if the action is default action(based on the setting for 
          the specific pending signal, in the signal action table), 
          current process is abnormally
          terminated - such a termination by a signal is known as 
          abnormal termination !!! 
        - signal action for a process will be taken only when that 
          process is in running state - for more details, see below !!!

   - each process also has a signal mask field in the process descriptor
     of the process - if a particular bit of a signal is set in this 
     signal mask, the corresponding signal is said to masked or blocked - 
     meaning, this is a way to temporarily mask/block  a signal or a set of 
     signals - such control can be achieved using a specific system call
     by the developer on a process !!! however, there are certain signals
     , which are special and are exempted from masking - these are known 
     as non-maskable signals !!! SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are these two - they 
     are typically used to unconditionally control a process !! 
          - if a signal is said to be masked or blocked, even if the 
            signal is pending, no action will be taken by the system
            as long as the corresponding signal's signal mask field 
            bit is set !!! developer can control this setting on a 
            per signal basis !!!
          - certain sections of a process may be critical and sensitive
            to signals - to prevent signals from interfering with such
            sections, signal masking/blocking mechanism may be used !!!
          - SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are known as fatal signals - meaning,
            will be taken without fail !!!

   - what happens if a process is blocked in sisuspend() 
     ??/
        - process is blocked in sys_sigsuspend() waiting for
          signals - SIGTERM and SIGINT 
        - let us assume that SIGTERM is generated for this process
          from another process / system !!!
        - corresponding bit in the signal pending field of 
          target process is set 
        - because SIGTERM is unmasked in the mask passed to 
          sigsuspend(), target process will be woken up 
          and added to ready queue !!!
        - some time in the future, this process will be 
          scheduled on the processor 
        - before resuming in user-space, system will scan the 
          signal pending field of the current process(target process
          is current) 
        - system will scan the signal action table of the current 
          process - if it is default action, current process is 
          abnormally terminated, immediately - sigsuspend() will
          never return to user space - meaning, process is terminated
          inside the system call - this is a common scenario with 
          respect to signals and system calls !!!
        - if a non default action is setup and a user space signal
          handler is installed , what will be the action from here ???
           - the system space code will now resume the process
             in the user-space and jump to the signal handler for
             the respective signal, in user space !!!
           - user space signal handler is said to be executing 
             asynchronously with respect to the main() of this
             process - however, user space signal handler is 
             also treated as part of this process !!! an asynchronous
             handler is not supposed to block or invoke a blocking 
             system call API - this another convention universal 
             in computing !!
                   - the original user-space context saved 
                     when the system call was invoked must be
                     saved safely 
                   - a new user space context must be generated 
                     for the signal handler's execution !!!
            - assuming that user space signal handler finishes, 
              what will be the next sequence of actions ???
                   - after finishing the signal handler, 
                     signal handler is forced to execute 
                     a special system call API - this is 
                     a trick played  by the operating system !!!

            - what will happen if the process enters system space 
              again with the help of a trick and a system call API ??
                    - reload the original user space context that 
                      was saved during signal handling - by doing 
                      this, we will return to user space and resume
                      from sigsuspend() !!!
            - for the above to work, operating system manipulates
              system stack as needed and user space stack as needed- 
              you must get used to such tricks and this will help 
              you understand concurrency better !!!


   - a signal may be generated for a process that is in Running state or 
     in blocked state - if a process is in Running state(Running/Ready) 
     and a signal is generated, the corresponding signal bit is set and 
     signal action/handling will be processed in the near future by the
     system, when the sytem has opportunity !!! if the process is in 
     interruptible blocked state and a signal is generated, the process
     will be woken up as well as process descriptor will be moved 
     to ready state !!!in addition, corresponding signal pending bit 
     will also be set !!!
        - what will happen, if a process is prematurely woken up 
          due to a signal ?? what will be the consequence ???
           - meaning, after it is wokenup and it is scheduled ???
                - if the action is default, process may just be
                  terminated !!!
                - if the action is developer decided, an alternative
                  signal action may be taken with help of a signal 
                  handler !!! 

                - if a process is blocked ina system call API, 
                  it may be woken by a signal , if that signal
                  is currently not blocked in the context of 
                  current  process !!! if a signal is masked in the
                  context of the current process and a signal 
                  arrives, signal bit will be set inthe pending 
                  field of the pd, but process will not be woken up -
                  like this, there are many peculiarities in signals !!!

 
   - if a process is blocked in uninterruptible blocked state and 
     a signal is generated, corresponding signal pending bit will be 
     set, but process will not be woken-up - this is the reason 
     for a special blocked state known as uninterruptible blocked state !!!
          - this state may be used by the developers to ensure that 
            certain critical events for which a process blocks will 
            not be disturbed by signals !!!


   - a typical confusion is between signal generation and 
     signal action/delivery - do not confuse the above 
     rules by mixing signal generation and delivery - some 
     of the above rules apply only to signal generation and 
     some of the other rules only apply to signal delivery !!!
      
10. unix/linux signals related system call APIs and their details:

Note: as you read the below section, refer to example1.c and 
      msg_server.c - it is better to understand the system 
      call APIs along with examples !!!

    - sigaction() system call API 
    - it takes 3 parameters - first parameter the identity of th e
      signal no., second parameter is the pointer to struct sigaction {} 
      object, in user-space and third parameter is also a pointer 
      to struct sigaction {} object, in user-space !!! mostly, the 
      third parameter is unused - meaning, we can pass NULL !
         - let us understand struct sigaction {} fields
             - .sa_handler field is used to pass the signal
               handler's pointer for the specific signal passed
               as param1 of sigaction() system call API !!
             - .sa_flags field will be used to set certain 
               flags such that behaviour of the signal handler
               can be modified !!! to start with, we will not 
               be setting any flags - meaning, flags will be set to 0 !!
             - .sa_mask field is the signal mask field used when 
               the corresponding signal handler is executing - do 
               not confuse with other signal masks - this signal mask 
               is entirely different and is valid only during the 
               executiion of the specific signal handler !!!


    - sigaction() system call uses the information provided in 
      second parameter to fill appropriate fields of the corresponding 
      entry in the signal action table of the process, in system space - 
      the entry will correspond to that of the signal's identity mentioned
      in first parameter of sigaction() system call API !!!

    - using sigaction() system call API, it is possible to provide
      a signal handler, which is different from the default signal action !!!
      - if such a signal handler is installed using sigaction() system 
      call API, when corresponding signal is pending and signal handling/
      action is taken, the system will process/execute the corresponding 
      signal handler and then, resume the process as before - meaning, 
      signal handler will be executed in user-space and process will be
      resumed to continue in users-space as before !!!

    - signal handlers are similar to interrupt handlers, but execute 
      in user-space and serve  processes, in user-space  !!!

    - signal handlers are expected to be short and must not execute
      blocking system call APIs - in addition, signal handlers can 
      execute concurrently with the process's main code - however, 
      no race-conditions are allowed !!! it is an asynchronous routine !!!
        - any asynchronous routine must follow most of these 
          rules !!!
        - meaning, must not block inside an asynchronous
          handler and must not invoke blocking system call APIs
          in asynchronous system call APIs  
        - race conditions due to such asynchronous handlers are
          difficult to manage !!! this will be clear when we understand
          about locking mechanisms !!! 
        - main() of a process and a signal handler may execute concurrently 
          within a process - however, a signal handler is not a process
          - meaning, it must not block - however, if it executes concurrently 
          with respect to a process, it may face race conditions with respect
          to main() /other parts of a process - this must be taken care
          differently - we cannot use conventional locks - meaning, semaphores
          and similar blocking locks cannot be used !!! 
        

    - signal handling is a complex task handled by the system - 
      as a developer, you must understand the rules of the  
      signal handler and install it - the system will take care
      of executing it at appropriate times, when corresponding 
      signal is generated and is pending !!!  

    - let us assume that you must use a signal handler for a specific
      signal in your process and due to the coding constraints you 
      are faced with race condition between certain code of your
      main() and certain code of a signal handler !!! how would 
      you solve this problem ?? ideally, you can give a clear 
      answer after studying IPCs !!! still, is there a way to solve
      this problem using signal related system call APIs ????
          - semaphores cannot be used !!!!

                    

    - sigprocmask() is another system call API that can be used
      by the developer to set the signal mask field of a process - 
      by doing this, we can control the signal mask field of 
      the process and also control the response of a process 
      to different signals !!!
           - using this, one or more signals can  be blocked/masked
             or unblocked/unmasked as needed !!

    - using sigprocmask(), the second parameter helps in setting 
      the signal mask field of the process, in system space !!!
      first parameter is the command that enables us to tell 
      sigprocmask() system call API to use the second parameter to 
      set the signal mask field of the process !!!

    - refer to example1.c - this is the example you will be modifying 
      and using in assignment2 - in this, sigprocmask() is used to 
      control the signal mask field of the process - you may continue
      using the signal mask field as per your requirement!!! in 
      addition, you  may use sigaction() to install appropriate 
      signal handler for specific signals in example1.c - in addition, 
      you may use sigsuspend() system call API to control blocking/
      wake-up of a process that may execute example1.c !!!
 
    - sigsuspend() is a tricky system call - its functionality 
      is explained in the comments given in example1.c - in addition, 
      following is a detailed summary of its functionality :

          - it blocks a process and enables a process to block 
            for signals (events that may generate signals) -
              it enables a process to block for a set of signals 
              while being blocked in sigsuspend() system call API !!!
          - sigsuspend() takes a mask field - this mask field 
            will decide, which signals will be blocked during 
            sigsuspend() call and which signals will not be !!
Note: system will use different mask fields per process, in 
      different contexts - you must not be confused and you 
      must not mix up one mask with another - system takes
      the responsibility of using the appropriate mask for
      appropriate context !!!
          - signals that are not blocked in the signal mask 
            passed to sigsuspend() will be allowed to wake-up 
            the process blocked by sigsuspend() system call API !!
          - if no signal handler is installed for an unblocked signal,
            the process will wake-up, but system will take appropriate
            default action and most likely this action will be 
            termination of the process !!!
          - if a signal handler is installed for an unblocked signal,
            the process will wake-up, system will process the signal 
            handler and the process will resume its execution after
            the signal handler - this is effectively resuming after 
            sigsuspend() system call API !!!  
                - if a signal handler is installed, sigsuspend will
            block, wakeup , execute the handler and resume process 
            after sigsuspend() - such implementation peculiarities
            are very common in operating systems !!!     

          - if the signal bit of a signal is set in the signal mask
            field of the process,the corresponding signal will not 
            be delivered/no action by the system  if it is generated 
            for the process - meaning,the corresponding signal will be 
            set in the signal pending field and will not be delivered 
            till the corresponding signal's bit in the signal mask field 
            of the process is reset to 0 - this is just a form of control 
            for a process with respect to signals !!!  


11. execution flow of a multi-tasking application which has a parent and 
    several processes :

    - flow of execution is highly dependent on the underlying implementation
      ,scheduling policy of the processes and the no. of processors/cores
      in the system !!!
    - in a UP (uni processor) system the following are true :
         - in most modern unix/Linux systems, child process
           may be scheduled to execute first - may not be true also
         - the meaning is that child process is given preference
           by the scheduler - we may change it by certain settings !! 
         - let us assume that a child process is created from a 
           parent process and it is a simple multitasking - in this
           case, child will execute first as per the above rule, after
           fork() - meaning, after the fork() system call API is executed
           by the parent, control is passed to the scheduler() - scheduler()
           prefers to schedule the child process first, not parent process
           - when the child process completes execution and invokes
           exit() system call API, child process is terminated and control 
           is passed to scheduler(), again - assuming our parent process
           is eligible for scheduling, scheduler() will resume our 
           parent process - parent process will complete its work and 
2P:wq
           invoke exit() system call API - when exit() is invoked, parent 
           process will terminate and control will be passed to the scheduler()
           , again !!! this is one way of visualizing execution flow of 
           parent and child processes, in a uniprocessor system !!

            - by manipulating command line parameters of operating system 
              kernel, we can force the operating to use only one processor
              from several processors, in the system - this is mainly useful
              to understand many system call APIs and working of the system !!!
            - we may change this setting any time as needed 
            - in our lab machines, we can modify certain setting such 
              that we can enable the system to execute in UP mode or 
              MP processor mode 
            - for our lab machines, this will be done by administrator - 
              if you do not have this setup, ask the admin.    

     


    -  in a MP(multi processor) system the following are true :
          - after fork() system call API, parent process will 
            create a new process and the new process may end up 
            in the ready queue of another processor !!! after fork() 
            system call routine, system will end up invoking scheduler()
            on the current processor and parent may  be eligible  to 
            resume, if the child is pushed to another processor's 
            ready queue - meaning, child is now under the control 
            of another processor's scheduler !!!
          - at the same time or some other time, child process may 
            be scheduled by another scheduler on another processor !!!
            meaning, parent and child process may be executing in
            parallel on other processors !!!  
          - the above is a possible scenario in a MP system - 
            depending upon load conditions and load-balancer implementation,
            we may find other possible scenarios !!!
          - in a multiprocessor system, do not exepect any particular
            ordering of processes, as the processes may be scheduled
            on different processors as per their merits by 
            respective schedulers of the processors !!!
            
          - depending upon UP or MP systems, multitasking and execution 
            order might differ - as a developer, your code must be 
            tolerant and work consistently in all the above cases !!!
   
Note: the above statements are purely based on scheduler's behaviour - in addition,
      system may have other influences - for example, I/O issues, IPCs , 
      page faults and many more - so you may not see an exactly same set of
      results - they results may be slightly distorted !!! these are the 
      real problems of concurrency, in a real system and real applications - 
      you must use what is given here as guidelines and still understand 
      the behaviour based on your applications and system configuration !!!
      - it is very difficult to provide a strict order of execution in 
        these systems - we will see more of this during RTOS systems !!!!
      - using certain utilities, we can force the behaviour of the system 
        to a certain extent - examples are taskset, chrt and many more !!!



12. a few useful hints on waitpid() :

    - if a child process is terminated and the parent process invokes
      waitpid(), waitpid() will clean up the child process and 
      return a +ve no. - the +ve no. is the pid of the child process
      that has just been cleaned-up !!!
    - in addition, if a child process is cleaned-up , waitpid will 
      also return the exit code information via status variable whose
      address is passed as second parameter to waitpid() - you are not
      expected to interpret the status variable's information , directly-
      you must interpret the status variable's information using 
      macros provided in the man page of waitpid() !!!
    - if waitpid() is invoked by the parent process and no child process
      is currently in terminated state, the parent process will be blocked
      by waitpid() - system will ensure that the parent process will be 
      woken up when a child process enters terminated state !!! system
      generates a SIGCHLD signal to the parent process, when a child process
      enters terminated state !!!
    - waitpid() must be invoked several times to clean-up all the children
      of a parent process - this may lead to calling waitpid() , in a loop,
      but the loop must be broken when waitpid() returns -1 - meaning,
      when all the children processes of a parent process are cleaned-up,
      waitpid() returns -1  

    - using specific macros, status field may further investigated !!!
      - refer to sample codes for different macros - refer to manual 
        page of waitpid() for further information !!!
      - WIFEXITED() is a macro that will return true, if child process
        has terminated normally !!!
      - WEXITSTATUS() is a macros that will return the value of the
        exit status code returned by child process via exit() - see the 
        details given above in this text !!!      
      - combination is useful - refer to sample code !!!
      - refer to other macros in manual page of waitpid() to understand
        more on abnormal termination scenarios - we will explore more
        on abnormal termination scenarios during unix signals !!!


 
13. as per the understanding and working of fork(), execution flow of 
    parent process is fairly clear - it is more based on execution of 
    a system call API - like any system call API, control is passed to 
    system space and control is returned to user-space - refer to diagrams
    in day1's slides !!!
    - in addition, fork() creates a new process with all the qualities described
      above, in this text - in addition,child process is added to ready queue
      of the system !!1  some time in the future, child process will be scheduled
      to execute - it is expected to execute from the system space and return to
      user-space - when returning to user-space,  it will return with a return
      value 0 - how is this forced ??? can we visualize this behaviour ???
        - when the child process is being created, its execution context is 
          is provided by the parent process - this execution context must 
          be manipulated by the fork() system call routine in system space -
          if this is done, when the child process gets opportunity to be 
          scheduled on the processor, it will resume as per the earlier context 
          that was setup by the fork() system call routine !!!! 

14. the above are the standard rules for process control - a developer or 
    system is expected to work as per above rules for efficient process
    control of processes !!!     
    - what happens if a parent process terminates without cleaning up 
      its children processes due to various reasons - parent process may 
      terminate abnormally or might fail to clean up some children processes
      due to  bugs and many more scenarios !!!
    - if a parent process terminates without cleaning up a child process, 
      child process is reparented to init process (with PID=1) by the system-
      this ensures that child process always has a parent and it is the 
      responsibility of the init process to clean up such reparented 
      children processes, when they are terminated - such reparented processes
      are known  as orphaned processes - they can continue executing normally -
      there are no special restrictions !!!
    - in general, you may not be able to see a zombie process - this is because, 
      a parent process or init process has a close watch such zombie processes !!
      if such a zombie process terminates, they are immediately cleaned-up - in 
      the rare case that parent process has not immediately cleaned-up the child process,
      you may see such a zombie process !!!

15. although all Linux systems have many things in common, there are subtle
    difference  :

         - version of the operating system distribution will be different 
                - class system uses opensuse 11.3 vs lab system uses
                  opensuse 11.2 
                - further, each sw component may also be of different version
                     - operating system core version is 2.6.34-<extraversion>
                       in the class system 
                     - operating system core version is 2.6.<xxx>-<extraversion>

                - depending upon the operating system distribution version and 
                  depending upon core version, system parameters will be set up 
                  differently !!!

16. process level multitasking and thread level multitasking may be useful
    in the following contexts :

            - network programming 
            - driver programming and testing
            - multiprocessing / HPC coding
            - rtos programming
            - embedded programming 
            - many more depending upon your area of work !!!



17. sched_yield() - read the manual page and also understand the following statements :

    - this API was introduced to support yielding among processes with realtime
      priorities and realtime policies !!
    - for instance, if we use FIFO(PRIO) real time scheduler in Linux, if all processes
      have equal prority,the behaviour is first in first out - in addition, developers
      may use sched_yield() to implement cooperative scheduling policy between these
      equal priority processes - these techniques may be useful in custom, engineering
      and scientific applications !! may not appeal to a desktop system !!!!
    - although this is applicable for real time policies, Linux has implemented
      it for non real time policies as well !!!
    - in order to enable this feature for non real time policies, you must 
      set a system parameter ;

                  /proc/sys/kernel/sched_compat_yield 
                  
                   echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_compat_yield (enables sched_yield()) 
                   or
                   echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_compat_yield (disables sched_yield())
    - the above settings need super user priviliges - meaning, you need to login 
      with super account !!!!
